Ex-EADS chief held longer in fraud probeStory Highlights Detention of former co-chief at Airbus parent EADS extended in fraud probe  Noel Forgeard being questioned about alleged insider trading from 2006  Forgeard exercised stock options shortly before share price plummeted  French market regulator also investigating 16 of his former colleagues   PARIS, France (AP) -- The detention of a former co-chief executive of Airbus parent EADS has been extended, a French judicial official said Thursday.  The official said Noel Forgeard, who resigned from the company in 2006, was being questioned in connection with an investigation into alleged insider trading.  The official spoke was not authorized to talk publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. Forgeard was taken into custody on Wednesday and can be held for another 24 hours. An investigating judge could then file preliminary charges and order him jailed. Investigators are looking into the sale of EADS shares by top executives and shareholders before a June 2006 announcement of delays for the A380 wide-body airliner that made EADS shares crash 26 percent in one day. The French market regulator last month initiated sanction procedures against Forgeard and 16 of his former colleagues, many of whom continue to work for the company.  EADS chief executive Louis Gallois said in a letter to staff last month that his &quot;confidence in EADS managers is total.&quot; Forgeard, 61, was named the first president and CEO of Airbus in 2001 after 12 years in the Lagardere Group, now one of EADS' top shareholders.  Decades ago, he served as industrial adviser for then-Prime Minister Jacques Chirac -- France's president from 1995 to 2007.  Forgeard was named co-chief executive of EADS with Thomas Enders, now head of Airbus, in 2005. In March 2006, he exercised 2.5 million euros ($3.92 million at the time) worth of stock options, just before Airbus announced costly delays to the A380 super jumbo. In a newspaper interview last month, Forgeard said he did nothing wrong but acknowledged that &quot;in hindsight, it would have been better if I hadn't done it.&quot;

Countdown to the superjumbo







	
	
	
	



 (CNN) -- Over the coming months, Business Traveller will keep you up to date with the plane's progress as the first superjumbos come off the production line.The A380 is designed to carry an average of 555 passengers over distances up to 8,000 nm/ 15,000 km. To-date, 166 A380s have been ordered. Plans for the A380 to be delivered to first operator Singapore Airlines have been postponed to October 2007.DecemberThe A380 has been busy this month, completing its latest route-proving mission around the world. Route proving is a key element of the certification process, demonstrating that the superjumbo can work smoothly with airport infrastructure, from taxiing and docking, to cleaning and refueling. Route proving also gives the A380 the opportunity to meet another of its certification requirements -- 150 flight hours of continuous airline style flight operations. Five development A380s have now flown. Four are involved in the flight test program, while the fifth is undergoing cabin fit-out in Hamburg. NovemberThe Airbus A380 has been undergoing a final series of test flights this month designed to lead to the superjumbo's air-worthiness certification by the end of the year. It has flown around the world, taking off from Toulouse and stopping off in Singapore, China, South Korea and Japan before returning to France. Airbus has received orders for 166 superjumbo jets, including five from Korean Air Co. -- South Korea's largest passenger carrier and the world's biggest cargo airline.However it suffered a blow earlier in the month when FedEx cancelled its order for 10 A380-800F freighter aircraft and switched to rival U.S. planemaker Boeing. Thai Airways have not ruled out the possibility of canceling its order for six aircraft as delivery delays force it to alter its long-term business plan, an executive for the airline said on Friday. OctoberNot the best of months for Airbus. It announced on October 24 that it needs to sell 420 of the superjumbos in order for the program to begin to make money. It's previous estimate of 270 proving woefully inadequate.This comes after the extent of the A380 delivery delays were revealed earlier this month, leaving airlines reeling. Singapore Airlines will not receive the first of its 10 planes until next October, while Emirates, the airline with the largest order of 43 planes, will not take delivery until August 2008. Compensation, which could be hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars, will have to be paid to the 15 airlines with A380s order, while many airlines have said they will be reviewing thier orders.Bad news for the A380 this month spread to rest of Airbus. First it announced a cost-cutting program that will lead to company-wide job losses, then its CEO Christian Streiff resigned on October 9 after only three months in the job. His position became untenable as he tried to streamline the company's cumbersome management structure arousing the wrath of the German government. He has been replaced by Louis Gallois, who becomes the company's fourth CEO in 16 months. SeptemberIt has been a turbulent month for the troubled A380 project. Airbus' parent company, EADS, announced that there would be further delays to the delivery of the airliner. &quot;The current status is that we have not finalized the schedule of deliveries nor the financial impact of any delays. All appropriate resources are focused on bringing the ongoing assessment to maturity,&quot; it said in a statement on September 22.The admission that there will be further delays comes after the replacement of Charles Champion as head of the superjumbo project earlier this month - the third official to lose his post after previous setbacks. Airbus blamed the previous set of delays on wiring installation problems. Champion has been replaced by Mario Heinen, a 50-year-old executive from Luxembourg, who had been in charge of the single-aisle range of A320-family jets. Better news was the successful test flights earlier this month from Toulouse carrying 474 Airbus staff. Each had secured their places on the historic flight through a company lottery. During the seven-hour flights over France, Spain, Britain and Germany, 30 Airbus cabin experts and manufactures were aboard to test on-board features, with the galleys, seating, air-conditioning and in-flight entertainment all put through their paces. Another obstacle to the project is the ruling from the International Civil Aviation Organization in November on the A380's &quot;wake vortices&quot; -- the air turbulence behind the aircraft that can be dangerous to other airliners flying close behind it. A temporary maximum exclusion zone has been imposed as a precaution, which if made permanent would delay planes behind the super-jumbo and significantly affect its efficiency. AugustAustralia's Qantas Airways is to receive more than A$100 million (U.S.$77 million) in damages from Airbus for delays in deliveries of its 12 firm-ordered A380-800s. It has meanwhile confirmed orders for four more Airbus A330 twinjets, two of which will be leased. Qantas, which has been one of the world's most profitable airlines in recent years, said on August 16 its net earnings for the year to June 30, 2006 plunged 30.4 percent to A$480 million ($370 million), compared with A$688.5 million a year earlier. Revenue rose 8.6 percent to a record $10.2 billion. The airline will take delivery of its first Airbus A380 super-jumbo in late 2007 and will also introduce the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in 2008. Qantas said its pre-tax profit of A$671 million recognized A$104 million in liquidated damages from Airbus due to the delayed delivery of the A380. JulyNews about the A380 took a backseat to its smaller counterpart, the A350, during the week of the Farnborough Airshow in England, which kicked off on July 17.Airbus announced that the A350 would get a revamp in a bid to boost orders of the mid-size plane, which is less popular than its Boeing counterpart, the 787-Dreamliner.The A380 was not altogether absent from Farnborough, though. The aircraft took part in the daily flying displays at one of the biggest events on the aviation calendar.New Airbus CEO Christian Streiff, in the job for two weeks, acknowledged at a press conference on the first day at Farnborough that the company was in crisis following the management fallout over wiring complications with the A380 that has led to production delays of the superjumbo. &quot;Airbus is in the middle of a severe crisis in its relations with its customers,&quot; Streiff told reporters, adding that the company had faith in the A380 superjumbo.Noel Forgeard, who was co-chief executive of Airbus's parent company EADS, resigned on July 2, two weeks after Airbus had announced that wiring problems with the A380 would lead to delays to deliveries of the aircraft.The incident highlighted communication problems between the directors of Airbus and EADS and called into question the competence of Forgeard and Airbus chief executive Gustav Humbert, who also resigned.Pressure on Forgeard grew when it was revealed he had sold EADS stock options in March, before the production problems were made public, netting himself a profit of almost 2.5 million euros ($3.2 million). Forgeard maintains he was unaware of production problems when he sold the shares.His resignation comes as part of a management shake-up aimed at restoring investor and customer confidence after Airbus disclosed the A380 production delays. Meanwhile, Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic Airways said on July 16 his company was in talks with Airbus about changing the mix and number of its plane orders to fill a possible gap caused by delays in deliveries of the A380. On July 21, Singapore Airlines gave Airbus a significant boost by ordering 20 of the new A350 XWB planes, becoming the first airline to commit to the revamped aircraft. The Asian carrier said it also plans to exercise an option to pick up nine more of A380s, despite anticipated delays to the delivery of the superjumbo -- pushing Airbus' total orders or commitments at the Farnborough International Airshow beyond those reached by U.S. arch rival Boeing . On July 25, Airbus acknowledged it had reinforced the rear fuselage of the A380 after problems were detected, but insisted that the issue did not cause any further delays in the plane's production timetable. This came after a report in German weekly Der Spiegel describing the fuselage troubles.June 2006 Airbus announces fresh delays to deliveries of the A380 on June 13.&quot;We have had an industrial delay. It will shift the program to the right by six to seven months,&quot; John Leahy, Airbus chief commercial officer, said.Leahy said the company was still on track to have the plane certified and to deliver its first aircraft to Singapore Airlines by end-2006, but deliveries in 2007 would be cut to nine aircraft from an original target of 20 to 25.Airbus said there would also be shortfalls of between five and nine planes in 2008 and of around five in 2009. It declined to identify which airlines may be affected.Airbus faces fines for late delivery of aircraft under an earlier setback, which was also partly blamed on problems with producing the wiring in the plane's fuselage.Airlines around the world reacted angrily to the news, demanding compensation, reconsidering orders -- and in one case, striking a major deal with its rival Boeing.Singapore Airlines, the first to buy the A380, said on June 14 it would buy 20 Boeing 787-9 aircraft worth $4.52 billion and take options on another 20 planes.  May 2006 On May 7, the first A380, which will be delivered to Singapore Airlines, underwent a 15-hour flight before landing at London's Heathrow Airport.During five hours of ground testing, 474 passengers and 20 crew members simulated a 15 hours flight, during which they tried all cabin systems, such as the In-flight Entertainment System, the water and waste system and the air conditioning system.Passengers on board the aircraft were given individual tasks to perform at certain intervals in order to simulate a maximum stress on certain cabin systems. Some passengers brought laptop computers to test the performance of the in-seat power supply.While the tests were being carried out Richard Quest had a look around the aircraft.He writes: &quot;It does not appear very comfortable now but in six months, the first paying passengers will be settling into their seats aboard Singapore Airlines.&quot;The lucky ones will be sitting upstairs.&quot;For anyone who has flown in the exclusive bubble in a Boeing-747, the upper deck of the A380 is a very different animal. It is so much bigger. In fact, it is the width of any other main deck wide-bodied plane. And that puts it into perspective.&quot;The next six months will be very busy for Airbus as it prepares the A380 for its international debut. Until then, the plane is in Hamburg in Germany getting its cabin installed.&quot;Airbus report that another milestone was reached when in Dresden, Germany, where fatigue tests on the A380 reached 10,000 flight cycles. The test examines the A380's structural behavior by simulating structural stresses over a very condensed period of time. The tests are performed in purpose built hangar equipped with hydraulic cylinders to simulate structural load. The tests in Dresden started in September 2005 and will continue to run to 2008 to simulate 47,500 flights in total, including short and long-haul missions.

France: Insider trading at Airbus firmStory Highlights Scandal concerns huge selloff of EADS shares before A380 delays announced  Stock market regulator transfers investigation to Paris prosecutors' office French reports point to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired in June 2006   PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French markets regulator said Tuesday it has found evidence of insider trading at EADS, the parent company of Airbus.  In a report following an 18-month investigation, regulator AMF also alleged EADS had misled financial markets by failing to meet standards on the publication of information. While AMF's announcement did not mention Airbus specifically, its investigation was triggered when top management and shareholders carried out suspicious share trades in the time before EADS revealed severe delays to the production of the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet in June 2006.   Word of those delays caused shares in EADS to drop by a quarter at the time. EADS had reported in March 2006 that certain executives and major shareholders had sold shares during a pre-approved window, but AMF decided to investigate whether anyone who sold those shares knew the bad news about the delays was coming. Aviation analyst Howard Wheeldon, of brokerage firm BGC Partners in London, said the French investigation initially involved 21 people.  &quot;What they actually knew or didn't know in terms of the delay, (whether) there would be a delay announcement forthcoming -- it's very difficult, it's very complicated,&quot; Wheeldon told CNN. &quot;But I do seem to get the impression that the French regulatory authorities have got a long way down the line.&quot; French reports about the investigation have previously pointed to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired soon after the delay announcement in June 2006. Forgeard made a profit of some $3 million when he sold his stock in March 2006, and his three children also sold stock options. Forgeard has said the timing of the stock sale and news of the delays were an unfortunate coincidence.  Christian Streiff was hired in July of 2006 to clean up the problems at Airbus, but he resigned in October of that year after the company announced another lengthy delay in A380 production. The A380 finally completed its first passenger flight last October after two years of delays and cost overruns.

Oil retreats toward $130 a barrel in AsiaStory Highlights Oil retreats ahead of a report expected to show U.S. inventories grew last week   Midday in Singapore Thursday, crude oil was down 71 cents at $130.32 a barrel   Prices have been affected by threats against Nigerian oil facilities  Falling gasoline demand in the U.S. and volatility in the dollar have also driven rise    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Oil fell back toward $130 a barrel Thursday in Asia ahead of a report expected to show U.S. inventories of crude and petroleum products grew last week.  Prices remained volatile, though. Crude oil futures dipped below $126 a barrel Wednesday in New York before recovering to finish just above $131. Oil is being buffeted about by threats against Nigerian oil facilities, worries about falling gasoline demand in the U.S. and volatility in the dollar. Midday in Singapore, the light, sweet crude contract for July delivery was down 71 cents at $130.32 a barrel in electronic trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract finished the previous session at $131.03, up $2.18, after spending much of the day swinging between gains and losses. At its low in the floor session Wednesday, oil was more than $9 off the record high it hit last week above $135 a barrel. The reversal in Asia from the floor session's close came with a renewed strengthening of the dollar and ahead of the U.S. Energy Department's inventory report, to be released later Thursday.    In the last couple of days, the dollar has rebounded against both the euro and yen, receiving some support Wednesday as the U.S. Commerce Department said orders to American factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell by a smaller-than-expected amount in April.  Watch fishermen in Spain strike over high fuel costs &raquo; That was taken as a possible signal of a rebound in the slumping U.S. manufacturing sector, and in Asia currency trading the dollar was back near the 105 yen level, while the euro was around $1.5650. When the dollar declines, investors tend to buy commodities such as oil as a hedge against inflation. But a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive to investors dealing in other currencies, and the tendency usually reverses. Also, a survey of analysts by Platts, the energy research arm of McGraw-Hill Cos., indicated that U.S. crude oil stocks were expected to have grown 750,000 barrels in the week ended May 23. The Platts survey also indicated analysts were expecting a build in U.S. gasoline stock of 400,000 barrels, and a build in distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, of 800,000 barrels.   Prices were still being supported, though, by further threats against Nigerian oil facilities. Those threats led investors in the U.S. to at least temporarily set aside concerns about falling gasoline demand.  Watch how rebel activity in Nigeria is affecting oil prices &raquo; On Wednesday, the Nigerian rebel group The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta threatened new attacks on oil installations to mark the one-year anniversary of President Umaru Yar'Adua's inauguration. A weekend attack by the group on an oil facility cut about 130,000 barrels of the nation's oil production, according to Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, in a research note. News of disruptions in Nigeria, one of Africa's largest producers and a major U.S. supplier, have helped push oil prices higher over the past year. That contended Wednesday with the growing belief that U.S. demand for gasoline is falling as the average retail pump prices approaches $4 a gallon. That belief was supported by two new surveys showing Americans consuming less gasoline. Demand for gasoline fell 5.5 percent last week compared to the same week last year, according to the weekly MasterCard SpendingPulse survey. The survey also found that, on average, demand over the past four weeks is off 6.3 percent compared to the same period last year. A separate CreditCards.com survey of about 1,000 people found that more than half have cut back on their driving due to high fuel prices.  In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures fell 1 cent to $3.8143 a gallon while gasoline prices dropped 1.01 cents to $3.4375 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 4 cents to $12.035 per 1,000 cubic feet. July Brent crude fell 81 cents to $130.12 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London.

CNN Student News One-Sheet: Gas PricesStory Highlights Ever stop to think about what's behind the price at the pump  Look at where the money goes when you buy a gallon of regular gasoline   (CNN Student News) --   The price that your parents pay to fill up the family car is rising. Ever stop to think about what's behind the price at the pump? Here's a look at where the money goes when you buy a gallon of regular gasoline. (The percentages cited below, which are from the Energy Information Administration, may vary by month. This data is as of April 2008.) Crude oil: Currently, this is the biggest portion of the consumer's cost of gas. About 73 percent of what you pay for each gallon goes to crude oil suppliers. This is determined largely by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. The amount of crude oil produced by OPEC determines the price of a barrel of oil. Taxes: The U.S. government taxes gasoline, as do many state and local governments. On average, these taxes collectively account for 11 percent of the consumer's cost of gas per gallon. Gas prices vary from state to state primarily because of variances in taxes. In Europe, gas taxes are much higher, and so is the price of gasoline.  Refining: The cost of refining crude oil accounts for about 10 percent of the cost of a gallon of gas. Crude oil, or petroleum, must go through a refining process to turn it into useful products including gasoline. The stages of this process vary with the grade of gasoline or other kinds of products being created. Distribution and marketing: Crude oil is transported to refineries, then its refined product, gasoline, is shipped from the refineries to distribution points and then to gas stations. Transportation costs are part of the price of gas. Oil companies that make gasoline are competing for consumers' dollars, so they market their brands to consumers. The companies promote, or advertise, their gasoline by advertising. These advertising and distribution costs together account for about 8 percent of the price of a gallon of gas. Other factors: The elements listed above all factor into the price of gasoline, but there are other contributing factors. One is seasonal demand. In warmer months, when families tend to travel more, the price of gasoline usually increases, because there is more of a demand for it. Geography can have an impact on the price of gasoline your family pays versus that your cousin's family pays in another part of the U.S. In general, the further you are from oil refineries, the higher price you'll pay for gasoline due to higher distribution costs. Competition among gas stations often has an impact on price. Have you ever seen three or four gas stations located near the same intersection? What might the others do if one station lowers its gas prices? Service stations, like other businesses, have to make a profit to survive, so they set their prices based on all the factors we mentioned plus whatever profit the market (and the law) will allow.

You're not getting the job -- 25 reasons whyStory Highlights The economy, your location, industry trends can all influence your job status  Don't forget the common denominator in your job hunt is you  Your r&eacute;sum&eacute; should build a case for you to be hired for a specific position  Don't beat yourself up over a flubbed interview -- but be sure to learn from mistakes   By  Anthony Balderrama When you're job hunting, you can go mad if you think about the amount of factors beyond your control that affect your chances of getting hired.   The economy, your location, industry trends -- even the hiring manager's mood -- can influence whether or not you get a job.  Still, as nice as it would be to blame your lack of offers on external factors, you can't forget that common denominator in your job hunt -- from the r&eacute;sum&eacute; to the interview -- is you. Here are 25 ways you might be unknowingly sabotaging your own job search: The first steps 1. Not keeping track of your accomplishments When you're happy with your job, it's easy to forget about possible future job hunts. You never know when you'll end up looking for new work, and if you don't keep a running list of awards, promotions and accomplishments, you might not remember them when it's time to update your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. 2. Leaving on a bad note As much fun as it is to fantasize about telling off a bad boss, don't actually do it. Leaving a trail of angry bosses or co-workers will come back to haunt you when you need references.  3. Not networking If you're silent about your job search, your friends, family and colleagues won't think of you when they hear about job opportunities. 4. Only using the Internet Online job boards are fantastic resources, but you need to do some footwork if you want to increase your chances of finding a job. Contact companies whom you'd like to work for, even if there are no job listings. Not all companies advertise openings online. 5. Only searching for the perfect job Yes, your job search should be focused. After all, applying to every job posting that comes your way is a good way to waste time but not an effective way to find a job you want. However, if you approach your job hunt unwilling to accept anything less than the precise job title, pay, vacation time and hours you want, you're setting yourself up for disappointment. The r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter 6. Writing a generic cover letter If your cover letter looks like it could have come from a word processor template, right down to the &quot;To Whom It May Concern,&quot; don't bother sending it. Hiring managers look for a candidate who wants that specific position, not someone who sends out applications en masse. Write a new cover letter for each job application and include details specific to that company. 7. Typos Sending a cover letter or r&eacute;sum&eacute; filled with grammatical mistakes and typographical errors shows hiring managers you don't care about the quality of your work and probably not about the job, either. 8. Including your current work info as the best place to contact you Making sure employers can get in touch with you is important, but they shouldn't be contacting you at work. &quot;Potential employers are going to question if these people will search for a new job on their time,&quot; says Kathy Sweeney, r&eacute;sum&eacute; writer for the Write R&eacute;sum&eacute;. 9. Focusing on yourself and not on the company in the cover letter &quot;When 'I' is the predominant subject -- and there are times when it is the only subject of all the sentences in the cover letter -- it indicates to me that they don't understand my organization and its needs, and, in fact, says they don't care to know,&quot; says Dion McInnis, associate vice president for university advancement at University of Houston-Clear Lake. &quot;And therefore, I don't care to know them.&quot; 10. Not targeting your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to the position Just like the cover letter, your r&eacute;sum&eacute; should build a case for you to be hired for a specific position. If you're applying for a financial analyst position, don't waste space including your teenage stint as a lifeguard. The interview 11. Showing up late Nobody likes to be kept waiting, especially hiring managers evaluating whether or not you would make a good employee. 12. Dressing for the wrong job Your interview attire should match the dress code of the company, or be one step up. If the office dress code is business casual, wearing jeans and a t-shirt won't work in your favor. On the other hand, if you're told dress is casual, you'll stick out if you show up wearing a double-breasted suit. 13. Not asking questions When the interview comes to a close, the hiring manager will undoubtedly ask if you have any questions for him or her. Not asking anything is the equivalent of saying, &quot;I don't care all that much about the job.&quot; 14. Badmouthing a former boss When you talk to hiring managers about a previous employer, you're also talking about them. The way you talk about a previous employer is how interviewers think you'll talk about them in the future, so keep it civil. 15. Not paying attention Another way to show you don't care much about the job is to get distracted. Answering your phone, sending texts or digging through your bag tells the interviewer that your focus is anywhere except on the interview. 16. Not researching the position Your chief objective in an interview is convincing the hiring manager you're the best candidate for the job. How can you prove your qualifications if you don't have an idea of what skills you're expected to have and what your responsibilities will be? 17. Not researching the company Employers want to know that your motivation for work is more than a paycheck. If you demonstrate that you know something about the company's history, its goals and its culture, you prove you want to be a part of the company. 18. Forgetting common etiquette Don't cuss, chew gum, burp, take off your shoes, forget to shower or do anything else that's not appropriate in a business setting. Don't give the interviewer a reason not to hire you. 19. Forgetting you're being interviewed from the moment you walk in Just because you're not sitting down at a desk across from the hiring manager, don't think you're not being evaluated. For example, employers will often ask their receptionists if you were nice them. Even if your interview involves lunch or dinner, you're trying to get a job, not show off your ability to down tequila shots. 20. Bringing up salary too soon A rule of thumb is that you should never bring up pay; let the hiring manager do it. Of course employers are aware that you want to know about the salary, so they will bring it up when the time is right. Appearing too concerned with money suggests you aren't passionate about the position or the company. After the interview 21. Not sending a thank-you note Interview etiquette extends beyond the goodbye hand-shake. Follow up with the interviewer by sending a thank-you note, either by e-mail or in the mail. Not only is it standard business practice, it's also common courtesy. 22. Being over-aggressive in follow-up Thanking the hiring manager for the interview is acceptable. You can even check in to see if a candidate's been hired if you were given a deadline for the decision. However, calling, e-mail or stopping by the office repeatedly is not persistent; it's annoying. 23. Not learning from your mistakes Not every interview goes off without a hitch, so don't beat yourself up if you flubbed an answer or two. However, if you don't take the time to review each interview you go on, you're bound to repeat the same mistakes again and again. 24. Forgetting where you've applied and interviewed After a few weeks, you've applied at more than dozen places and probably interviewed with a few companies. Eventually it's harder to remember where you've sent a r&eacute;sum&eacute; or interviewed, and applying to the same place makes you look like an applicant who applies to any posting that pops up, not the best fit. 25. Stopping your job search while you wait for a response Even if your interview for the job of a lifetime went well, don't freeze your job hunt while you wait to hear back. For a variety of reasons you might not get the job, or you might stumble upon an even better opportunity. You don't have anything to lose by continuing the hunt.

Settlement may give online Realtors access to more listingsStory Highlights Consumers may save average of more than $2,000 under proposed settlement  Settlement means traditional Realtors will be allowed to use online sites to sell  Brokers will demand lower commissions and pass savings on to buyers  The agreement must be approved by a federal judge in Chicago   From  Terry Frieden Justice Producer  WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Home buyers could save an average of more than $2,000 under a settlement with the National Association of Realtors announced Tuesday by the Justice Department.   The proposed settlement ends the industry's anti-competition rules barring online brokers from viewing more than 800 multiple listing services nationwide affiliated with the National Association of Realtors.  The settlement, which must be approved by a court, means brokers will likely demand lower commissions because they don't have to conduct brick-and-mortar business, like driving interested buyers to homes. The cost savings could be passed onto the consumer.  &quot;Consumers should be able to save up to 1 percent of the price of a home,&quot; said Deborah Garza, deputy assistant attorney general of the Antitrust Division. She bases the percentage on the typical discount an online broker currently offers.  Citing 2006 figures, Garza said the median price of a home in the United States was $225,334. So, a drop of 1 percent in a Realtor's commission would be $2,253.  &quot;When there is unfettered competition from brokers with innovative and efficient approaches to the residential real estate market, consumers are likely to receive better services and pay lower commission rates,&quot; Garza said. Under the deal, the National Association of Realtors agrees to change its rules and require its 800 affiliated local Multiple Listing Services to repeal their rules as well. The government said the deal guarantees that Internet-based real estate companies will not be treated differently than traditional brokers. Antitrust officials said that under the new policy, traditional agents will not be permitted to withhold their listing from agents who serve their customers through virtual office Web sites.  National Association of Realtors President Richard Gaylord called the settlement &quot;a win-win for the real estate industry and the consumers we serve.&quot; &quot;The final order expressly provides that NAR does not admit any liability or wrongdoing and will make no payments in connection with the settlement,&quot; Gaylord said.  He termed the settlement a compromise, but Garza disagreed. &quot;I wouldn't call it a compromise,&quot; Garza said. &quot;We got the full relief we were seeking.&quot;  The settlement was announced by the Antitrust Division, which filed suit in 2005 against the industry group, claiming that its rules prevented brokers who offered online discount services from fully participating in the listing service.  Billions of dollars were at stake in the legal battle: In 2006, $93 billion was spent on brokerage services, with the media commission paid for a home sale just over $11,000. The agreement must be approved by the federal judge in Chicago, Illinois, who had been set to hear the case in July. Officials said they expect the settlement to be approved by the court this summer.

Obama: McCain 'out of touch' on housing woesStory Highlights Sen. Obama discusses the nation's housing crisis in Nevada on Tuesday  Obama: McCain's approach to housing problems are problematic  President Bush's response was &quot;too little, too late,&quot; Obama says  Obama proposes a $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund    NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama on Tuesday rolled out ideas he said will help stabilize the U.S. housing market, while saying President Bush's response was &quot;too little, too late.&quot;  He also called opponent Sen. John McCain &quot;out of touch&quot; with people struggling to keep their homes. &quot;We've had enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try approach from George Bush and John McCain,&quot; said Obama, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. &quot;We can't afford another president who can't be bothered to stand up for working people. It's time for a change.&quot;     Obama said he'd propose a $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund that would help homeowners modify their home loans to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy or help them sell the home if the payments grow beyond their means.  Watch Obama talk about the housing crisis &raquo; The Illinois senator also proposed amending bankruptcy laws to protect people trapped in predatory or misleading home loans and said that, as president, he'd raise penalties on lenders who break home-loan laws. &quot;Families should not be forced to stick to the terms of a home loan that was predatory or unfair,&quot; he said. &quot;It's time to close a loophole that protects special interests while punishing working people.&quot;  Speaking at a campaign event in the Las Vegas area, Obama said he supports legislation pushed by Sen. Chris Dodd, a former Democratic presidential candidate and chairman of the Senate's banking committee, that would have the federal government insure billions of dollars in loans for at-risk borrowers in exchange for lenders reducing loan balances that are greater than the appraised value of the homes. Obama said the plan, which is backed in the House by finance committee chairman Rep. Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, and which Bush has threatened to veto, would provide &quot;meaningful incentives&quot; for lenders to buy or refinance risky home mortgages and convert them into stable 30-year mortgages.   McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, has called for the creation of a Justice Department mortgage-abuse task force that would investigate and help federal prosecutors who are looking into abusive lending practices.   He's proposed what he calls a HOME plan that would allow homeowners who qualify, and are behind on their home loans, to apply to a Federal Housing Authority fund that would replace their existing loan with a government-backed one. But in his speech, Obama attacked McCain, saying the Arizona senator took too long to form a plan addressing the housing crisis and hasn't made it a priority since.  &quot;Sen. McCain is so out of touch with the struggles of working people that he gave a speech laying out his economic agenda last week, and he couldn't even be bothered to talk about a foreclosure crisis that has put so many families on the brink of foreclosure and our economy on the brink of recession,&quot; Obama said. Earlier in the day, Obama met with Felicitas Rosel and Francisco Cano, a maid and hotel porter he said worked for years to buy a home and now face losing that home because of a predatory loan.

A mileage mess with my mortgageStory Highlights Borrower was promised more than 18,000 frequent flier miles with his mortgage  Northwest Airlines and lending institutions neglected to deposit the miles  The airline contacted Home Loan Center and the miles were awarded   By  Christopher Elliott Tribune Media Services (Tribune Media Services) -- Northwest Airlines promises Dave Herstad 18,375 frequent flier miles when he applies for his mortgage. He gets the loan, but not the miles. After several rounds of finger-pointing between supervisors at Northwest, Lending Tree and Home Loan Center, his miles remain missing. What should he do? Q: You may be my last resort so I'm certainly hoping you can help me. Last summer I applied for a mortgage through Northwest Airlines and Lending Tree that entitled me to 18,375 frequent flier miles. I received a mortgage loan for $105,000, but I'm still waiting for my miles. Part of the problem is the finger-pointing between Northwest Airlines, Home Loan Center and Lending Tree. I have contacted Northwest customer service and it says the miles have to come from either Lending Tree or Home Loan Center. When I call either of them, they say that the other company needs to pay Northwest for the miles. I've been bounced around between supervisors, trying to get this sorted out. But every time I make some progress, a supervisor leaves and my case is turned over to someone else. Then we have to start again from the beginning. Can you please help me receive some resolution on this issue?  -- Dave Herstad, Bloomington, Minnesota A: You should have received your Northwest miles when your mortgage closed. This is a common problem with award miles promotions, because a third party -- a bank, mortgage broker, or some other company -- typically buys the rewards from the airline and then credits your frequent flier account. At least it's supposed to.  Phoning Northwest Airlines when your miles failed to show up was a good idea. Following up with your mortgage company by telephone was also a good idea. But staying on the phone was a mistake that cost you more than time. (I'll explain what I mean in a minute.)   You should have written to Northwest, copying Home Loan Center and Lending Tree. I list all the customer service contacts for the airline on my Web site. Having a paper trail ensures at the very least that you won't need to explain your situation to another supervisor, because there will already be something in writing. Repeated phone calls only guaranteed more finger-pointing and a resolution that has taken the better part of a year. But unlike a financial investment, frequent flier miles do not appreciate -- they actually decline in value over time. Just look at the last year's worth of announcements from any of the major airlines. They've made it more difficult to cash in your miles, demanded more miles for award tickets, and imposed restrictions on rewards programs that make your miles easier to expire. The longer you waited, the less valuable your promised 18,375 frequent flier miles became. There's no disputing that rewards programs are one of the most profitable parts of an airline's business (it's such a moneymaker that one carrier, Air Canada, spun off its rewards program into a separate business a few years ago). It's equally undisputed that frequent flier programs are habit-forming and can lead to all kinds of bad behavior, from buying an expensive airline ticket to needlessly refinancing your home. Now, I'm not saying that your mortgage was unnecessary. What I am saying is that promotions like the one you participated in can lead people to make decisions that aren't in their best interests. Doing it for the miles doesn't always make sense. I contacted Northwest on your behalf. The airline asked Home Loan Center about your mortgage, and your frequent flier account was promptly credited for your missing miles.

Oil price drops below $130 a barrelStory Highlights Oil prices fell below $130 a barrel Tuesday as demand eases  U.S. economic reports due this week may affect oil prices  Demand in China has analysts worried about diesel supplies   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices fell below $130 a barrel Tuesday on a growing sense that soaring gas and oil prices have cut demand for fuel during the normally busy U.S. summer driving season.  At the pump, meanwhile, retail gasoline prices rose, but only slightly, leading to renewed speculation that gas may follow the normal seasonal pattern of peaking around Memorial Day, then declining over the summer. Light, sweet crude for July delivery fell as low as $129.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange Tuesday, then edged up to trade down $2.28 at $129.91. Prices peaked at $135.09 a barrel Thursday. Last week's surge in oil prices drove gasoline prices sharply higher just before the long Memorial Day holiday weekend in the U.S. But those increases appear to be tapering off.   &quot;I think that we're going to see that that is the peak or very close to it,&quot; said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy &amp; Economic Research Inc. in Winchester, Mass. Lynch thinks energy investors are selling on recent data showing that Americans are driving less due to high prices -- including weekly Energy Department reports that demand for gasoline is falling and a Federal Highway Administration report showing Americans drove fewer miles in March.  Energy Department data showing demand for gasoline over the Memorial Day holiday period won't be released until next week. If oil prices continue to fall, gas prices may not reach $4 on a national basis as some analysts have predicted. Still, prices are already above $4 in many parts of the country.

Asian oil holds at $133 a barrelStory Highlights Militants' attack on a pipeline in Nigeria supports high prices   Dollar gains ground on the yen and euro in Tokyo trading  In London crude futures rose 36 percent to $132.73 a barrel  China urges oil companies to ensure enough supplies for Olympics     BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Oil held steady above $133 a barrel Tuesday in Asia amid worries about global petroleum supplies and the outlook for the U.S. dollar.  Reports of an attack by militants on an oil pipeline in Nigeria, one of Africa's largest oil exporters, also affected prices. Mid-afternoon in Singapore, light sweet crude for July delivery was up 95 cents from Friday at $133.14 a barrel in electronic trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Nymex floor trading was closed Monday for Memorial Day in the U.S., and electronic trading levels were little changed from the day before during Asian hours. Monday was also a bank holiday in Britain, and trading volumes were lower than usual. In London, July Brent crude futures were up 36 cents at $132.73 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange. Memorial Day holiday officially kicks off the American summer driving season, and analysts are expecting the seasonal demand for diesel and gasoline to provide additional support for prices. The dollar, which had been slipping over the last week after a modest recovery, showed some renewed vigor in afternoon currency trade in Tokyo, gaining ground against both the yen and euro. But investors will be watching economic data out of the United States to be released over the next few days for further clues about the health of the world's biggest economy. Reports are expected this week on U.S. consumer confidence, new home sales, gross domestic product and other key economic data. If the reports show the economy's weak trend is continuing or deepening, that would push the dollar lower, which would in turn boost oil prices.    Oil and other hard commodities are seen as hedges against a weakening greenback and inflation. Also, a weak dollar -- the currency of international trade and a key factor in oil's rally from about $65 a year ago -- makes petroleum products less expensive to Asian and European buyers. Prices were also supported by Monday's news of the latest in a spate of oil-pipeline bombings in Nigeria. The country's main militant group, the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, said the sabotage of a pipeline-switching station marked the anniversary in office of President Umaru Yar'Adua. He took power May 29, 2007 with a promise to calm the oil region.   The local joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell confirmed there had been a pipeline attack and said &quot;some production&quot; had been shut down to allow crews to contain the crude spilling from the ruptured conduit. Last week, a series of supply warnings shook markets and Thursday, a report that the International Energy Agency -- the energy watchdog for the most industrialized nations -- is in the process of lowering its forecast for long-term global oil supply, sent crude futures rocketing to an all-time high of $135.09 a barrel. Investors are also worried about a growing squeeze on global diesel supplies as demand in China surges has sparked a massive run up in heating oil prices.   Over the weekend, China's top economic planning agency again urged oil and power companies to make sure there are enough supplies for earthquake-hit areas and for the Beijing Olympic Games in August. In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures rose 8.85 cents to $3.9541 a gallon while gasoline prices rose 3.56 cents to $3.4316 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 20.2 cents to $12.059 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Supply fears keep oil above $133Story Highlights Falling U.S. dollar seen as one factor keeping oil prices high  U.S. economic reports due this week may affect oil prices  Demand in China has analysts worried about diesel supplies    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Oil rose above $133 a barrel Monday on persistent worries about global petroleum supplies and the outlook for the U.S. economy and the dollar.  Reports of an attack by militants on an oil pipeline in Nigeria, one of Africa's largest oil exporters, also helped boost prices. Light, sweet crude for July delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was up 98 cents at $133.17 a barrel in electronic trading by afternoon in Europe. The contract rose $1.38 to settle at $132.19 a barrel on Friday. Nymex floor trading was closed Monday for Memorial Day and it also was a holiday in Britain, resulting in lower trading volume than usual. In London, July Brent crude futures rose $1.13 to $132.70 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.   The dollar has weakened over the last week after a modest recovery, and investors will be watching economic data out of the United States to be released over the next few days for further clues about the health of the world's biggest economy. Watch analysts weigh in on the falling U.S. dollar &raquo; &quot;The dollar's been swinging down again,&quot; said Mark Pervan, senior commodity strategist at Australia &amp; New Zealand Bank in Melbourne, and that's &quot;going to sway sentiment.&quot;  Oil and other hard commodities are seen as hedges against a weakening dollar and inflation. Also, a weak dollar, the currency of international oil trade, makes petroleum products less expensive to Asian and European buyers. This week, investors will be watching for what implications U.S. consumer confidence, new home sales, gross domestic product and other economic data might have for the dollar and oil prices, he said. &quot;It's a pretty price sensitive week for economic data,&quot; Pervan said. &quot;The data we're seeing out of the U.S. at the moment looks pretty weak. You'd expect that trend to continue, pushing further down on the dollar.&quot; The dollar, one of the factors that has fed oil's rally from about $65 a year ago, was lower against the yen, but up a bit against the euro in currency trading during the afternoon in Europe after losing ground Friday in New York. The euro slipped to $1.5764 compared with $1.5775 on Friday, while the dollar fell to 103.41 Japanese yen from 104.17 yen Friday. Prices also were supported when militants in Nigeria, a major supplier to the U.S. market, claimed they destroyed an oil pipeline and killed 11 soldiers in a gunbattle. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta says it attacked the pipeline operated by a Royal Dutch Shell PLC joint venture early Monday. Shell officials were not immediately available for comment, and a military spokesman had no immediate confirmation of any overnight incidents. Last week, a series of supply warnings shook markets, and Thursday, a report that the International Energy Agency -- the energy watchdog for the most industrialized nations -- is in the process of lowering its forecast for long-term global oil supply, sent crude futures rocketing to an all-time high of $135.09 a barrel. Investors are also worried about a growing squeeze on global diesel supplies as demand in China surges has sparked a massive run up in heating oil prices. Over the weekend, China's top economic planning agency again urged oil and power companies to make sure there are enough supplies for earthquake-hit areas and for the Beijing Olympic Games in August. &quot;They certainly want to have a buffer of supply ... so there's pressure on the upside from demand in Asia,&quot; Pervan said.  The U.S. driving season officially kicked-off with the long Memorial Day weekend there, and even if demand for gasoline and diesel is lower than it was a year ago, it will still be stronger than it was in the preceding months, he said. In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures rose 7.89 cents to $3.9445 a gallon while gasoline prices rose 2.95 cents to $3.4255 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 18.2 cents to $12.039 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Ex-EADS chief in 'insider trading' probeStory Highlights Investigators are looking into the sale of EADS shares by top execs, shareholders  Forgeard told judges &quot;he had not committed insider trading,&quot; his lawyer says  Judges' probe into alleged insider trading at EADS was opened in late 2006    PARIS, France (AP) -- French judges filed preliminary insider trading charges Friday against Noel Forgeard, a former co-chief executive of Airbus parent EADS, his lawyer said.  The investigating judges ordered Forgeard freed after two days in the custody of financial police pending the investigation, lawyer Jean-Alain Michel said. Investigators are looking into the sale of EADS shares by top executives and shareholders before a June 2006 announcement of delays for the A380 superjumbo that made EADS shares crash 26 percent in one day. Forgeard has denied wrongdoing.   Forgeard told judges Xaviere Simeoni and Cecile Pendaries during questioning &quot;that he had not committed insider trading&quot; and that to his knowledge neither had any other EADS executives, his lawyer said. Preliminary charges under French law mean the investigating judges have strong reason to suspect involvement in a crime, giving them more time to investigate. Judges decide later whether or not there is enough evidence for a trial. These charges do not mean &quot;an element of guilt,&quot; Michel said.  Forgeard, who resigned from EADS in 2006, was detained by authorities Wednesday morning, in a new blow to the company as it emerges from a rocky couple of years plagued by trouble with the A380 and management turmoil. Airbus is also now suffering the fallout of difficulty in the global airline industry linked to soaring fuel prices. The judges' probe into alleged insider trading at EADS was opened in late 2006. Last September, the French financial market watchdog AMF issued a preliminary report pointing to suspicions of &quot;massive&quot; insider trading by 21 top managers of European Aeronautic Defense &amp; Space Co. NV between November 2005 and March 2006.

Ex-EADS chief held longer in fraud probeStory Highlights Detention of former co-chief at Airbus parent EADS extended in fraud probe  Noel Forgeard being questioned about alleged insider trading from 2006  Forgeard exercised stock options shortly before share price plummeted  French market regulator also investigating 16 of his former colleagues   PARIS, France (AP) -- The detention of a former co-chief executive of Airbus parent EADS has been extended, a French judicial official said Thursday.  The official said Noel Forgeard, who resigned from the company in 2006, was being questioned in connection with an investigation into alleged insider trading.  The official spoke was not authorized to talk publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. Forgeard was taken into custody on Wednesday and can be held for another 24 hours. An investigating judge could then file preliminary charges and order him jailed. Investigators are looking into the sale of EADS shares by top executives and shareholders before a June 2006 announcement of delays for the A380 wide-body airliner that made EADS shares crash 26 percent in one day. The French market regulator last month initiated sanction procedures against Forgeard and 16 of his former colleagues, many of whom continue to work for the company.  EADS chief executive Louis Gallois said in a letter to staff last month that his &quot;confidence in EADS managers is total.&quot; Forgeard, 61, was named the first president and CEO of Airbus in 2001 after 12 years in the Lagardere Group, now one of EADS' top shareholders.  Decades ago, he served as industrial adviser for then-Prime Minister Jacques Chirac -- France's president from 1995 to 2007.  Forgeard was named co-chief executive of EADS with Thomas Enders, now head of Airbus, in 2005. In March 2006, he exercised 2.5 million euros ($3.92 million at the time) worth of stock options, just before Airbus announced costly delays to the A380 super jumbo. In a newspaper interview last month, Forgeard said he did nothing wrong but acknowledged that &quot;in hindsight, it would have been better if I hadn't done it.&quot;

France: Insider trading at Airbus firmStory Highlights Scandal concerns huge selloff of EADS shares before A380 delays announced  Stock market regulator transfers investigation to Paris prosecutors' office French reports point to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired in June 2006   PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French markets regulator said Tuesday it has found evidence of insider trading at EADS, the parent company of Airbus.  In a report following an 18-month investigation, regulator AMF also alleged EADS had misled financial markets by failing to meet standards on the publication of information. While AMF's announcement did not mention Airbus specifically, its investigation was triggered when top management and shareholders carried out suspicious share trades in the time before EADS revealed severe delays to the production of the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet in June 2006.   Word of those delays caused shares in EADS to drop by a quarter at the time. EADS had reported in March 2006 that certain executives and major shareholders had sold shares during a pre-approved window, but AMF decided to investigate whether anyone who sold those shares knew the bad news about the delays was coming. Aviation analyst Howard Wheeldon, of brokerage firm BGC Partners in London, said the French investigation initially involved 21 people.  &quot;What they actually knew or didn't know in terms of the delay, (whether) there would be a delay announcement forthcoming -- it's very difficult, it's very complicated,&quot; Wheeldon told CNN. &quot;But I do seem to get the impression that the French regulatory authorities have got a long way down the line.&quot; French reports about the investigation have previously pointed to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired soon after the delay announcement in June 2006. Forgeard made a profit of some $3 million when he sold his stock in March 2006, and his three children also sold stock options. Forgeard has said the timing of the stock sale and news of the delays were an unfortunate coincidence.  Christian Streiff was hired in July of 2006 to clean up the problems at Airbus, but he resigned in October of that year after the company announced another lengthy delay in A380 production. The A380 finally completed its first passenger flight last October after two years of delays and cost overruns.

Airbus flagship faces tough debut






	
	
	
	
	
	


LONDON, England (CNN) -- With capacity for more than 800 passengers and an operational range of 15,000 kilometers, the Airbus A380 superjumbo has caught the imagination like no other aircraft since Concorde.Early artist impressions showed passengers browsing in shops, sitting at cocktail bars or simply enjoying the extra space of the world's biggest-ever airliner. Jet set travel had never looked more glamorous.When the first A380 was unveiled at Airbus' Toulouse headquarters in January 2005 French President Jacques Chirac declared the aircraft the &quot;crowning achievement of a human and industrial adventure.&quot;Yet, as the A380 prepares to make its airshow debut at Farnborough and just a few months short of the aircraft's first scheduled flights, there are already doubts over the long-term future of Airbus' flagship project.Last month Airbus admitted production of the A380 was behind schedule and said many customers would have to wait longer than expected to take delivery of their orders.Then Noel Forgeard, CEO of Airbus' parent company EADS, and Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert both quit amid revelations that Forgeard had sold shares in the European aerospace giant just weeks before the news was announced. Although Forgeard denied any wrongdoing the move prompted accusations of insider dealing.Yet some industry experts believe that more fundamental issues than short-term delays and management difficulties threaten the success of the A380.While Airbus has staked its future profits on the super-size hub-to-hub carrier, main rival Boeing believes the real market is for mid-range point-to-point aircraft such as its forthcoming Boeing 787 &quot;Dreamliner,&quot; due to take to the skies in 2008.Jim Smith, Editor of Jane's Transport Finance, says the early indications are that the Boeing philosophy -- with more than 400 firm orders already in place for the 787 -- is more in tune with the demands of the industry.&quot;It's an unusual situation where two major manufacturers of any product go to the market at such opposite ends of the spectrum. But what is happening is that Boeing is emerging as the winner,&quot; Smith told CNN.Smith highlights Airbus' failure to secure any A380 sales to the U.S., where there is far greater demand for smaller aircraft than existing large planes such as the Boeing 747.He said Airbus also faced political opposition in the U.S. where airports have shown reluctance to adapt their facilities for an aircraft used only by overseas carriers.But Airbus Marketing Vice President Colin Stuart told CNN the company remained &quot;100 percent&quot; behind the A380, and said no orders for the plane had been cancelled despite production delays.&quot;We have a range of aircraft from the A330-200 to the A380, so we're offering those airplanes to the market to cover all types of needs in the international service area,&quot; said Stuart.&quot;Our market forecast indicated very strongly to us that there is a market for the current hub-to-hub services, which is between the major cities of the world. Our belief is that because the population of the world tends to be concentrated around those major cities they will continue to have a strong need for large aircraft.&quot;Customers want these airplanes because they want to fly flagship operations with an all-new airplane with tonnes of technological development onboard.&quot; Aviation expert Peter Morrell, of Cranfield University in southern England, said he believed there was demand for an A380-sized carrier, but said Airbus faced a long wait before they began to see any return on their 10 billion euro ($13 billion) investment.&quot;There is a market for an A380-size aircraft but it may not be quite as large as Airbus was anticipating,&quot; Morrell told CNN. &quot;And now the news coming out is not exactly encouraging to airlines who are sitting on the fence.&quot;Yet Smith believes Airbus' concentration on developing the A380 may also have cost it dear in the mid-range market, by allowing Boeing to steal a march with the 787 on its own next generation A350, which is not due to reach the end of the production line until 2010 at the earliest.&quot;Based on Boeing's command of the mid-range aircraft sector, I'm not sure I would be quick to rush the A350 to market because so many orders have been placed for the 787,&quot; said Smith.&quot;I think what I would do is develop that aircraft and put it on the market in maybe five years. There's just a limited number of planes that are going to be sold. Airbus needs to develop a much more fuel-efficient offering than the 787 and then try to sell that down the line.&quot;In an interview with CNN in 2004 Forgeard said he was prepared to take the fame or the blame for the A380.Yet, as his pet project takes to the skies over southern England, Smith believes Airbus could yet be counting the cost of its former CEO's ambition.&quot;If I was in the driving seat at Airbus I would have to look at the A380 as something that possibly we were not going to make money on.&quot;

Air industry defies talk of crisis






	
	
	
	
	
	


LONDON, England (CNN)  -- To the casual reader of the business headlines the air industry can sometimes appear to exist on the brink of near permanent calamity.Late last year, amid rising fuel costs, airline bankruptcies and billion-dollar losses, International Air Transport Association (IATA) Chief Executive Giovanni Bisignani described the problems facing aviation as &quot;the worst crisis in our history.&quot;But as Airbus struggles to deal with the fallout from production delays to its flagship A380 superjumbo, with Noel Forgeard -- CEO of Airbus parent company EADS -- and Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert both forced to quit over the affair, British Airways subject to an investigation into alleged price fixing and Brazilian flag carrier Varig the latest airline to suffer financial collapse, could 2006 be even worse?Peter Morrell, head of the Air Transport Group at Cranfield University in southern England, sees no reason for alarm. He says the difficulties of a few high-profile names should not detract from the overall health of an industry enjoying 5 percent growth a year.&quot;There may be the odd negative thing going on but the background to the aviation industry is economic growth. That has been a very positive aspect that has come through into spending on business and leisure travel over the past year or two,&quot; Morrell told CNN, highlighting increased profits at Virgin and Cathay Pacific and the continued success of low-cost airlines as recent success stories.&quot;The airlines may have had to cope with higher fuel prices but on the other hand they've been able to do so against a background of strong demand.&quot;Yet Morrell believes both success and failure can have a positive impact on the overall health of an industry undergoing a process of normalization after a long period in which politics and subsidies often clouded purely commercial considerations.&quot;The air transport industry has always been quite a special industry. I think we're moving towards it being a normal industry but there's still a long way to go,&quot; Morrell said.&quot;In a normal industry you get market entry, you get people failing and you get mergers. If you're a Brazilian World Cup supporter, it's not very nice if your Varig flight suddenly disappears but ultimately Brazil has quite a vibrant airline sector. So in a way it's just market forces working their way out.&quot;According to Jim Smith, Editor of Jane's Transport Finance, &quot;fuel burn&quot; is set to become the key issue determining market success and failure over the next few years as airlines battle to minimize the impact of rising fuel costs.&quot;It's a Catch 22 situation,&quot; Smith told CNN. &quot;You have to have money to invest in the fuel efficient aircraft. If you invest in the fuel efficient aircraft then you save money on fuel burn. If you're unable to afford fuel efficient planes then, firstly, you're probably not making any money and, secondly, you're more at the mercy of oil prices.&quot;Smith says airlines have also started experimenting with other cost-saving measures, many of them borrowed from low-cost operators, such as turning planes around as quickly as possible.&quot;People talk about meals on board and that sort of thing but that's nickel and dime stuff,&quot; he said. &quot;An airline doesn't make money while a plane is on the ground. The low-cost carriers have realized people will choose an airline based on price. It's no longer posh to fly -- planes have pretty much become flying buses. If you've got a cheap fare you can live for three or four hours like a sardine.&quot;Greater fuel efficiency could also help the air industry tackle environmental concerns, according to Morrell. But he also believes the introduction of carbon emissions trading schemes or international taxes on aviation fuel are necessary if airlines are to escape the green lobby's wrath.Nonetheless, even amid rising fuel costs and price increases to counter environmental concerns, he expects the air industry will continue to prosper, with big growth in the Middle East, India and China.&quot;Air travel remains a very attractive proposition. Even with high fuel costs it doesn't stop this inexorable demand for more and more air travel. Overall, it's a much better picture than it was after 9/11.&quot;

Makers battle for next generation










(CNN) -- The next generation of passenger jets from the world's biggest airplane manufacturers will soon be coming off the production line.With passenger traffic returning to pre-Sept. 11, 2001 levels, Boeing and Airbus hope that airlines will be signing up for their respective new planes in the years ahead.The battle stands between Boeing's mid-sized Dreamliner 7E7 aircraft and the larger Airbus' A380.But the long-standing rivalry now has extra impetus as the transatlantic rivals swap accusations over unfair government subsidies -- a row that recently reached the World Trade Organization. (Full story)Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard has also confirmed that his firm is discussing a new plane -- dubbed the A350 -- to compete head-on with Boeing's Dreamliner, based on technologies developed for its A380 jet.Even though the Airbus A380 super-jumbo does not start flying until 2006, and the Dreamliner 7E7 two years later, orders are already rolling in for both aircraft.Air France, Emirates, Qantas, Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines have all placed orders for the A380 super-jumbo. Air New Zealand, ANA, UK's First Choice and Italy's Blue Panorama have signed up for the Dreamliner.Boeing's mid-sized 7E7 plane is capable of flying to more destinations, frequently and with the capacity for up to 300 passengers. &quot;It is going to be a real workhorse for airlines,&quot; Kieran Daly from Flight International magazine told CNN.The A380 is a 555-seat airplane and will have fewer flights a day. &quot;It is very much bigger than what we have at the minute. It is clearly going to be a different experience for the passenger,&quot; says Daly.&quot;The vast majority of flights (for the A380) will be on a dozen or so heavily travelled routes typically in Asia, where enormous numbers of people need to be moved.&quot;As some airlines pull out of the travel slump, the question of rising fuel costs and fuel efficiency still remains. It helps that Boeing's 7E7 is 20 percent more fuel-efficient than older models, while the A380 has the advantage of carrying more people.&quot;The A380 burns a lot less fuel than any other airplane on the seat per mile cost, so it is very favorable,&quot; says Forgeard.&quot;An aircraft manufacturer does not sell weight -- they sell performance. The performance is a combination of the weight, fuel consumption and aerodynamics.&quot;The new planes also rely on a greater use of composite materials rather than conventional aluminium.The cabins could also be less pressurised. This should mean less fatigue, dehydration and headaches for passengers.Both airlines have talked about more space for flyers -- so they can move around, relax in larger seats or talk at an in-flight bar, though analysts believe this is unlikely.&quot;They have to fill the aircraft with what it was designed for -- that is carrying passengers. They are expensive investments,&quot; says Edward Plaisted, CEO of Skytrax Research, a flight market research firm.&quot;They are going to have to justify that investment, so first and foremost it is about seating capacity.&quot;-- CNN's Richard Quest and Leone Lakhani contributed to this report

Airbus' A380 prepares for takeoff










LONDON, England -- In a few months' time the world's largest commercial airliner will take to the skies for its maiden test flight, carrying with it the fortunes of European aerospace giants Airbus.Developed over five years with a budget of 11 billion dollars, the 555-seater Airbus A380 comes with a hefty $275 million price tag.With 50 airline commitments in place, 129 orders have already been signed and the first A380s off the production line are due to enter service in 2006.Spread across four European countries, Airbus has 6,000 engineers working on the A380, while more than 1,000 companies are supplying parts towards the project.But responsibility ultimately rests with two men: Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard and program director Charles Champion.&quot;It's a very big project, it's true,&quot; says Forgeard, who took charge of the company in July 2001.&quot;Certainly I will not tell you it's a small project. I am very much involved so I can tell you frankly that I'll carry the fame or the blame.&quot;The main technical issue in the development of the A380 has been keeping the plane's weight down to ensure it meets the performance specifications guaranteed to airlines vulnerable to rising fuel costs.&quot;The weight has been a challenge and is always a challenge in such a large aircraft so we have been working since day one to reduce the weight of the various components and now actually it's rather creeping down,&quot; says Champion.&quot;We are stabilizing towards a level which is compatible with the guarantees we have provided our customers.&quot;Forgeard also denies that increasing oil prices pose a threat to super-jumbos such as the A380.&quot;High fuel prices are very favorable to very economical airplanes, so high fuel prices are very favorable to the A380 which burns a lot less than any other airplane on the seat-mile cost,&quot; he says.Major challengeKeeping control over key project criteria such as weight or cost is a major challenge that requires good organization, especially for a company such as Airbus with major sites spread across Europe.While the A380's wings are assembled in North Wales, where 750,000 holes have to be drilled in each one, the plane's fuselage is built in Germany and France and parts of the tail section come from Spain.Then there is the small matter of getting it all to the final assembly line in Toulouse, France. Parts are shipped to Bordeaux, then floated down the Garonne river by barge and finally delivered by road.For Forgeard and Champion, the key to good management is delegation. Fortunately at Airbus they can rely on an expert and experienced staff. With many workers on the A380 pooled from other Airbus projects, only 20 percent working on the project are new to the company.&quot;We have segmented the project in what we called aircraft components, manufacturing and development teams,&quot; explains Forgeard.Champion adds: &quot;We decided to have small teams in charge of deliverables; the fuselage, the wing systems etc. Each of these teams is fully accountable in terms of budget, in terms of schedule, in terms of performance.&quot;You're sure that everything works well when the right guy, takes the right decision at the right time and at the right level. Otherwise if you end up controlling everything, it doesn't work.&quot;For his part Forgeard, takes responsibility for the overall direction of the project, ensuring it is on target to meet the demands of Airbus' customers. He is briefed weekly on the project, while the board gets a formal update once a quarter.But he is quite clear where his number one priority lies: ultimately, the airlines will make or break the A380. And if it fails to meet performance guarantees they're not going to buy it.&quot;I first check that the project is still tuned to the market needs, and it is,&quot; he says.&quot;I have to check that the airlines remain committed and they are. I visit them regularly to check their heart.&quot;

In Focus: Noel Forgeard, CEO, Airbus










LONDON, England (CNN) -- When European plane makers Airbus unveiled plans to build a 555-seat superjumbo in 2000, there were doubts over the company's ability to pull off the $11 billion program.But with 129 orders for the $275 million A380 -- which will be the world's largest airliner -- already signed, and with the plane due to fly early next year, Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard tells CNN's Becky Anderson about steering the project towards success.CNN: Give us a sense of how important this A380 is to Airbus. Effectively you've bet the company's future on it, haven't you?NF: No, I think that's an excessive way of putting it. At Airbus we used to have a product range from 100-seaters up to about 380-seaters. We have a four-to-six hundred and we had a hole in the area of very big planes. So with the 380 we fill this hole in order to have the full product range. But you see, I think your expression would be justified if we'd had to take on huge amounts of debts or things like that to finance the 380 and it's absolutely not the case. We have so far totally financed the 380 and we plan to continue to do so. The word &quot;bet&quot; is not appropriate.CNN: Okay, but just give me a sense of how important the 380 is to Airbus.NF: Well, the market of very big airplanes represents 10 percent of the number of airplanes in the global market, but it's closer to 25 percent in terms of revenue. So it's a significant portion of the market in terms of revenue, equivalent to the other big segments of the market. In that respect it means a changing of scale in Airbus revenues and profitability.CNN: Why was the decision to make this plane the right decision? Give me a sense of what went into the thought process and the planning of the A380.NF: During the 90s there was an increasing feeling among the airlines that something was wrong with the biggest airplane at the time, the Boeing 747, because it appeared that this airplane had operating cost per seat that were about the same as smaller airplanes of the time -- the triple seven and later on our A345 and 600. So the airlines said, &quot;What the hell? Normally when an airplane is bigger you should have better costs. And couldn't you imagine, Airbus, an airplane that would have lower operating costs. In the ballpark of 15 to 20 percent lower operating costs per seat-mile? Couldn't you also, Airbus, introduce new cabin amenities in terms of space for passengers, have internet on board and so on? Couldn't you imagine an airplane that could be environmentally very friendly, very green in terms of noise emissions and so on?&quot; And from 1996 Airbus started to have a customer focus group of about 20 airlines to imagine together what such an airplane could look like. And when we pressed the button at the end of 2000 it was on the basis of a program that had been jointly agreed between our customers and ourselves.CNN: How important was that transportation crisis and what roles did the airlines play in providing the sort of analysis you needed in order to put this together?NF: Well, not an important role, not an essential role, but the role. The fundamental role. They designed with us everything. So in terms of the weight the airplane should have, the range it should have, the specifications of the major systems, we designed these things with them in all respects.CNN: Aside the airlines we have regulators, airports, who else was involved?NF: Well, at that stage, not so much the regulators of the airports because we quickly came to the conclusion that if an airport had to make major investments to receive the A380 it would not work. So we have designed the A380 to be basically compatible with all airports operating 747s. And so it's the case we have no measure of difficulties with airports any longer. It's only Los Angeles, which has an interim solution to service the A380 so definitive investments will come a little later. But as soon as it puts the interim into service, it will be able to receive the A380 as well.CNN: Let me just talk about the ruling in Hamburg against the runway extension there. How are you going to surmount a setback like that? Because it surely is a setback at this stage.NF: Well, no. Frankly it's a minor event. You know that the first level of judgment is never definitive and we shall go to the court of appeal. And if very, very unfortunately the ruling is negative, we would have what it takes to have an alternative solution in Toulouse, so it does not threaten the program at all. But I would be very disappointed for our German colleagues because we have built this program with a certain kind of work share that I would really like to keep.CNN: OK, Let's go back to the consultation process. Who, ultimately, made the decision to go ahead with the A380?NF: Well, first, there was Juergen Thomas (special advisor to Airbus' CEO), who was really the spirit of this project from the beginning. Then it came to general management level at Airbus; myself, of course, and some others. And obviously on a project of this size the shareholders. That is to say ELS on the one side, Arnaud Lagardere, then chairman of EADS, Manfred Bischoff (Chairman of EADS) from the German side, as well BAE Systems' Mike Turner.CNN: Was it an easy decision?NF: Well it was, for a project this size it was a rather easy decision, yes. Of course it was discussed, debated. But you know, as long as there was a genuine, sincere, strong expression of interest by the customers it was a rather easy decision, yes. Because finally it took three months between September and December of 2000.CNN: Give us a sense of the initial budget at the development phase of this plane.NF: There was no initial budget -- there is a budget that is still the same. And that is 10.7 billion dollars in the economic conditions of December 2000 and it is still the budget.CNN: How much of that was used in the development?NF: Well, it's a complex question. We have a little over 60 percent engagement because the budget also includes continuous development during the first years as well as derivatives, a number of derivatives including freighters that should enter into service in 2008.CNN: How involved are you in this project on a day-to-day basis as CEO?NF: I am very much involved. I can tell you frankly I'll carry the fame or the blame, with my colleagues, of course. So I am involved in marketing campaigns, together with our brilliant chief commercial officer. We have worked together on all the launch customers, and we work on a few prospects that we have right now, that will materialize in the 12 months to come. I work a lot also with the teams internally on the control of the project. We have very strong management team. We have segmented the project into what we call aircraft components, manufacturing and development teams, and each of these teams report to Charles Champion (executive vice president). Each of these teams addresses a deliverable part of the aircraft, such as wings. They have a head and a fully fledged management team with people taking care of design, manufacturing, finance, procurement and, last but not least, the financial controller.CNN: Lets talk about the project, give me a sense of the enormity of the responsibility then that you feel as CEO for what is ultimately one of the biggest project management cases in its history.NF: Well it's a very big project. I won't tell it's a small project because it's a very big project. But it's not unusual in this industry. When airbus launched the A330 and the A340 family in the 80s it was about seven billion dollars at the time, so you see it was very comparable. Then we have done the A340-500 and -600 which were about 2.5 or 2.7 billion and which are behind us now and went well. So the A380 is a very big project but it's not by any extent something that is out of the normal scope of such developments. And I repeat, it happens that companies bet a lot on bigger projects. But it's absolutely not the case here. We have so far self-funded totally the development. Our cash position is higher than at the creation of the company. We capitalize no cost whatsoever; all our R and D costs are depreciated each year in full compliance when the aircraft enters into service. Any cash, any revenues, will go down directly into our bottom line.CNN: What sort of cost control measures are in place to ensure that this project stays on budget, because it would be incredibly easy to go over the budget? Give us a sense of the difficulty and what sort of controls are there in order to make sure they stay within your budget limitations?NF: Each of the aircraft component leaders commit on a yearly budget. They each have a financial controller who reports, as in any good organization, to our chief financial officer so we know exactly at each point in time where we are. We know the areas in which we are absolutely ok. We know the areas in which there are some tensions. Everything is transparent: we have a few little tensions in the systems area, and in the forward fuselage area but we are confident due to a better situation in the other areas, that we will stay inside the budget. And for the internal rate of return for the project, for the profitability of the project at completion, even more important than the non-recurring costs is the way we sell the recurring costs. And today we have evidence that our recurring costs are in control and we hope will do better than we thought.CNN: For those who don't understand about balance sheets or don't read balance sheets on a regular basis just explain what you mean by the recurring costs?NF: I mean the production costs. The production costs of the aircraft that will be the basis on which we shall trade margins in the future. Because in the future on each aircraft sold we shall trade the margin, which is the difference between the revenue and the production cost -- what I called the recurring cost.CNN: What's your sense of how this project is moving along? You will have signed off on projections at the start of this project. How did those projections that you originally signed off on compare with the way that the project is progressing to date?NF: Well, first we have signed off on a long-term base of customers which today is absolutely firm. Again there is nothing to hide. The only long-term customer that has slightly postponed deliveries is Virgin Atlantic, which has confirmed its order but asked for postponement 18 months. All the others are okay, with very few months delay on the Air France side due to terminal issues, but otherwise everything is okay on the side of the customers. Of course we have friendly debates with them because all the people would like to have splendid equipment on board, but splendid equipment is weight and weight is the enemy of the aircraft manufacturer. And we have a healthy debate on that. And on the side of performance of the aircraft, what can I tell you we shall see during the flight tests from the first quarter of 2005? It would be stupid to anticipate at this stage. But I think at this stage of the development we have a very good control of performance. And we do not anticipate any major difficulties.CNN: Let's just talk about the issue of weight. The weight of the aircraft is creeping up isn't it? Is this due to what your customers are asking for onboard and how does that effect the efficiencies of this plane going forward?NF: Well, it's very simple: an aircraft manufacturer does not sell weight they sell performance. The performance is a combination of the weight, fuel consumption and aerodynamics. The performance we have sold we delivered without any exceptions. And so the aircraft, the airborne exterior meets the performance guarantees we have given. The mistake we have made maybe in terms of communication is to make public the objectives that we set for ourselves on the side of weight which is just one of the parameters. To compare this to the internal objectives we had given ourselves, we are a little less than two percent more which is absolutely not abnormal and absolutely not worrying, the best illustration of that being that we did deliver all the performance guarantees we have given.CNN: It may not be a problem for you, but in a rising oil price market, particularly when one considers the price of oil two-and-a-half years ago, as this project gets closer to its delivery date, you are working in a quite different geopolitical climate, so you must have to appreciate what your customer is going through when they see issues like weight increases. Surely there will be elements that will have to be stripped back to in order to allow for a change in the weight?NF: You're absolutely right. But, first, high fuel prices are very favorable to very economical airplanes, so high fuel prices are very favorable to the A380 which burns a lot less than any other airplane on the seat-mile cost. Second, now if on this side we see where we are in terms of what we call specific fuel consumption we shall be better than we thought. The first engine is now flying on the flight test bed and it delivers excellent performance. I'll take this opportunity to congratulate Rolls Royce who designed it.CNN: How do you as the Airbus CEO ensure that this project is ultimately a success?NF: The CEO has to be able to scan all aspects of such a big project. So I first check that the project is still tuned to the market needs, and it is. I have to check that the airlines remain committed, and they are. I visit them regularly to check their heart. I have to check that we are in control of the performance, so I review the project regularly with the engineers. On the cost side, every two months we review the cost, in which I participate, to see where we see ourselves in terms of cost at completion, both for fixed cost and for the unit cost and so far so good.CNN: What do think the most difficult parts of this project are to keep on track?NF: I would say equipment vendors because we've got such a huge community of equipment vendors. By the way, I do not know if you know the man sitting in front of you is the number one customer of the U.S. aerospace industry. I am the first customer in the world of the US aerospace industry for the values of vendors from whom we buy between five and six billion U.S. dollars a year. At this time, you see a debate on out-sourcing, in-sourcing. We in-source a lot of jobs in the US. And so this huge community of vendors, the U.S. vendors, the European vendors, we have to keep them on track so they deliver on time and on quality. Sometimes it's difficult because we've asked for very aggressive commercial conditions, and some of them try to escape.CNN: When you first came to this project, could you conceive of, did you conceive of being at this point as quickly when one considers the enormity of this task? It only happens that new planes are developed, what, every 20 to 30 years. The longevity of these projects are enormous and the responsibility on the shoulders of a CEO who runs a project like this is enormous. As you say, it's not the make or break of Airbus, you say it's not necessarily an enormous bet, but the responsibility must be huge.NF: Yes, yes, it is, but Airbus is a family, Airbus is a community, it's not a one-man show. By the very nature of the business, there is a lot of attention on the company, the product, on me, but that's not the reality. There is a very strong corporate culture in Airbus which is made of innovation, attention to customers, and I would like to say it is true that my responsibilities are huge. I feel myself extraordinarily well supported by the Airbus community.CNN: From the outside looking in, this is a classic pan-European project. Does it feel like that to you these days -- that this is a project without boundaries -- or has Europe for a businessman like you become one big economic space?NF: Totally, 100 percent. The Airbus company is totally unified. We have a unique management team. I think we've made huge progresses in the integration of Airbus, and I answer your question without any reservations, yes. Maybe with one caveat: it is not a political flagship for Europe. Airbus is a commercial company, privately-owned and listed on the stock market, and the project is totally commercialCNN: You feel no pressure from political administrations that this project must be successful?NF: Well, I think they all expect it to be successful, but I'll tell you that the Airbus team and myself, we do not need external pressure to deliver a success.CNN: Okay, so give us a sense of the way the relationship with Rolls Royce works and the importance of that relationship and how you went about developing that relationship to get to the point that you're at now?NF: We have two engines. We leave the engine choice up to the airlines. One of the possible choices is Rolls. There is a possible alternative choice which is what they call the Engine Alliance, which is a joint venture of GE Aircraft Engines and Pratt and Whitney. And both Rolls Royce and Engine Alliance have won about half the market each. Now with each of those we have very close relationship.CNN: Do you seek some price guarantees, because it's the airlines that buy the engines and that must be written into the full cost of the design of the A380?NF: Generally an airline will buy their frame from us and then run a competition that sometimes may take a few months longer than the frame competition. So to ensure the best conditions we love competition between engine manufacturers.CNN: We want to get a sense of the potential complications that a project like this has, when its wings are made in one place, its fuel injection in another, the issue of transportation of the various parts...NF: It's not new. All Airbus airplanes, by the way all Boeing airplanes as well, are designed and manufactured in various places. For instance, our competitor does a lot, it's not a secret, in Japan or in Italy, or in parts of the United States different to their final assembly site. We have always done the same. There is nothing new except that the airplane is so big that the parts cannot come by airplane, and so we had to resolve those infrastructure difficulties to get the things to Toulouse by ship and barge. So, it's a minor disturbance. It has required a lot of work it's true. But aircraft components are not heavy, so the transport is not very onerous. I think we are more concentrated now on bases than our competitor is because we're what you describe as intra-European. Our competitor is less concentrated in its base, the U.S., and more looking for work outside the U.S. borders.CNN: You suggested that there is a degree of pad in the weight of the plane, which has crept up, and you managed that without any problems. I was wondering how much pad there was, whether it is in the budget and how much pad there is in the timeline? You have said you are confident you have hit the timeline. How much room for maneuver is there?NF: We do not anticipate any necessity for an additional budget. I don't know what I can tell you. In any project of this kind, the CEO keeps some contingency for himself. I am ok with the contingencies I have. On weight I am okay because finally the performance is delivered. The last aspect of the schedule is that we shall fly in the first quarter of 2005, so this is okay. We anticipate entry into service in the second quarter of 2006. Maybe at the beginning of the program we saw it at the beginning of the second quarter, maybe today we see it more at the end of the second quarter.CNN: My final question would be what sort of characteristics you looked for in the management team on the A380? If you were writing your autobiography now and you thought about what had gone into putting this team together and how you have created a champion team, what would they be?NF: First, a champion team is a very good description, because that's the name of the guy responsible for the project -- Charles Champion. I have always tried to build success on people, individuals, so of course we look for good competence, good engineering competence, good experience, experience of management in terms of cost controlling and also leadership. You know, to overcome the very numerous difficulties of such a program, you need to have people with a strong character who never surrender, who always go further and who inspire spirit and faith in their colleagues.

Airbus firm ex-chief held in fraud inquiryStory Highlights Judicial official: a former co-chief at Airbus parent EADS held in fraud case  Noel Forgeard allegedly detained in probe into extensive insider trading  Forgeard exercised stock options shortly before share price plummet   PARIS, France (AP) -- A former co-chief executive of Airbus parent EADS was detained Wednesday in connection with an investigation into alleged insider trading, a French judicial official said.  Noel Forgeard, who resigned in 2006, can be held for up to 48 hours for questioning. The official was not authorized to talk publicly about the case and spoke on condition of anonymity. Investigators are looking into the sale of EADS shares by top executives and big shareholders before a June 2006 announcement of delays for the much-anticipated A380 wide-body airliner. EADS shares crashed 26 percent in one day. The French market regulator last month initiated sanction procedures against Forgeard and 16 of his former colleagues, many of whom continue to work for the company. EADS spokesman Pierre Bayle declined to comment Wednesday. EADS CEO Louis Gallois said in a letter to staff last month that his &quot;confidence in EADS managers is total.&quot; Forgeard was named co-CEO of EADS with Thomas Enders, now head of Airbus, in 2005. In March 2006, he exercised 2.5 million euros ($3.92 million at the time) worth of stock options, just before Airbus announced costly delays to the A380 super jumbo. In a newspaper interview last month, Forgeard said he did nothing wrong but acknowledges that &quot;in hindsight, it would have been better if I hadn't done it.&quot; EADS shares rose 2.9 percent to 15.10 euros ($23.80).

Airbus parent EADS back in profitStory Highlights Airbus parent EADS reports a net profit in January to March quarter of $440 million  In the previous five quarters, EADS has been in the red four times  Seeking to cut exposure to dollar by shifting production, increasing defense work  Cost-cutting plan after delays at Airbus, which accounts for two-thirds of sales    PARIS, France (AP) -- Airbus parent EADS said Wednesday it returned to profit in the first quarter as the planemaker increased deliveries and the company cut costs, helping offset the weaker dollar.  European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co reported a net profit in the January to March quarter of &euro;285 million ($440 million), compared with a loss of &euro;10 million a year earlier. In the previous five quarters, EADS has been in the red four times. Shares in the company were up 7 percent to &euro;16.82 ($26.03) in early trading Wednesday in Paris. CEO Louis Gallois said in a statement the results are &quot;encouraging.&quot; &quot;Though many serious challenges have been overcome there remains much to do,&quot; he added.   EADS didn't change its expectations for earnings this year, but warned of a possible &quot;negative impact&quot; from the weakening dollar later in the year.   The dollar's slide against the euro makes it harder for Airbus to compete against Boeing Co. Unlike its U.S. rival, many of Airbus' costs are in euros, though it sells its planes in dollars. Gallois is seeking to reduce EADS' exposure to the dollar by shifting production to the dollar zone and increasing defense work.  EADS said it is progressing with a restructuring program, dubbed Power-8, which aims to shed 10,000 jobs by 2010 and transfer some factories to suppliers to share the financial risk of the mid-size A350 aircraft.  Some of those talks recently broke down, but EADS said it expects to conclude sales of two factories in Germany and Britain in coming weeks.   The cost-cutting plan was devised after multiple delays to the A380 superjumbo and a redesign of the A350 -- the planned competitor to Boeing's 787 -- wiped billions of euros off EADS' profits. In the first quarter sales increased 10 percent to &euro;9.9 billion ($15.3 billion) from &euro;8.9 billion a year earlier. Earnings before interest, taxes, goodwill impairment and exceptional items -- a measure of profit favored by analysts -- increased almost ninefold to &euro;769 million ($1.23 billion) from &euro;88 million. That exceeded analysts' expectations of &euro;359 million ($555 million), according to a poll by Dow Jones. EADS predicts 2008 revenues will exceed &euro;40 billion ($61.9 billion), with an EBIT of &euro;1.8 billion ($2.8 billion). The forecast is based on Airbus delivering about 470 airplanes in the year and taking over 700 orders. It does not take into account the additional delays to the A380 superjumbo announced Tuesday, which may result in financial penalties from airlines. Airbus, which accounts for two-thirds of EADS' sales, reported earnings before interest and taxes of &euro;698 million ($1.08 billion) in the quarter after a loss of &euro;69 million a year earlier.

Airbus: Delays in A380 deliveriesStory Highlights Airbus says time needed to assess financial impact of delivery delays  Company is trying to switch to serial production of the jumbo plan  Parent company EADS to announce earnings on Wednesday    PARIS, France (AP) -- Airbus on Tuesday announced new delays on deliveries of the superjumbo A380 this year and next, saying it needs more time and resources to get the planes ready.  The European aircraft maker said in a statement Tuesday that it will deliver 12 planes in 2008 instead of 13, and 21 planes in 2009 instead of 25. It said deliveries for 2010 will be discussed with customers in the coming weeks. The A380, the world's biggest passenger plane, was plagued by production delays that repeatedly pushed back the delivery of the first jet to Singapore Airlines last year. Airbus said it will take more time to determine the financial impact of the revised delivery schedule and the extent of additional costs. The company could have to pay penalties to airline customers for any aircraft delivered later than agreed. The company is trying to switch over from individual production of the planes to serial production. Airbus said time and resources needed for individual production were &quot;higher than expected,&quot; causing delays to the changeover. Airbus, which is owned by European Aeronautic Defence &amp; Space Co., has delivered four A380s to Singapore Airlines so far, and 17 more are in various stages of production. EADS is to release first-quarter earnings Wednesday.

France: Insider trading at Airbus firmStory Highlights Scandal concerns huge selloff of EADS shares before A380 delays announced  Stock market regulator transfers investigation to Paris prosecutors' office French reports point to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired in June 2006   PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French markets regulator said Tuesday it has found evidence of insider trading at EADS, the parent company of Airbus.  In a report following an 18-month investigation, regulator AMF also alleged EADS had misled financial markets by failing to meet standards on the publication of information. While AMF's announcement did not mention Airbus specifically, its investigation was triggered when top management and shareholders carried out suspicious share trades in the time before EADS revealed severe delays to the production of the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet in June 2006.   Word of those delays caused shares in EADS to drop by a quarter at the time. EADS had reported in March 2006 that certain executives and major shareholders had sold shares during a pre-approved window, but AMF decided to investigate whether anyone who sold those shares knew the bad news about the delays was coming. Aviation analyst Howard Wheeldon, of brokerage firm BGC Partners in London, said the French investigation initially involved 21 people.  &quot;What they actually knew or didn't know in terms of the delay, (whether) there would be a delay announcement forthcoming -- it's very difficult, it's very complicated,&quot; Wheeldon told CNN. &quot;But I do seem to get the impression that the French regulatory authorities have got a long way down the line.&quot; French reports about the investigation have previously pointed to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired soon after the delay announcement in June 2006. Forgeard made a profit of some $3 million when he sold his stock in March 2006, and his three children also sold stock options. Forgeard has said the timing of the stock sale and news of the delays were an unfortunate coincidence.  Christian Streiff was hired in July of 2006 to clean up the problems at Airbus, but he resigned in October of that year after the company announced another lengthy delay in A380 production. The A380 finally completed its first passenger flight last October after two years of delays and cost overruns.

Boeing beats Airbus on ordersStory Highlights Boeing beat Airbus on orders in 2007 with 1,413 to Airbus's 1,341  Airbus won on deliveries with 453 new aircraft compared with Boeing's 441  Plane makers enjoyed a record year in 2007 but sales will slow in 2008   (CNN) -- European plane maker Airbus fell behind Boeing on orders in 2007, but said it delivered more aircraft than its U.S. rival.  Plane makers enjoyed a record year for orders in 2007. Boeing came out on top with 1,413 net orders, beating Airbus's 1,341. Airbus delivered 453 new aircraft compared with Boeing's 441. The two companies are competing furiously, particularly for increasing demand from China, India and the Middle East. The order Emirates placed for 70 A350 XWBs and 11 A380s from Airbus last year was the largest the plane maker had ever received in terms of value, estimated at $20.2 billion at catalogue prices.   In 2007 Airbus won 33 new firm gross orders for the A380, including 12 from British Airways - the first time the UK carrier selected Airbus for its long-haul fleet.    Despite an increase in demand for jets, it has also been a period of turbulence for Airbus. Delays and losses of its A380 and A350 widebody proved costly and earnings have also suffered in the face of a weak U.S. dollar.  To preserve competitiveness, the airline is in the midst of a restructuring program that aims to find $2.95 billion in savings by 2010 and cut 10,000 jobs.    Boeing is also going through a troubled patch. Bad news first hit last October when the plane maker announced a six-month delay to its Dreamliner 787. This week, further delays were announced bringing the first test flight back to June and the first deliveries to early 2009. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO said in a statement, &quot;2007 was a challenging but also successful year for Airbus.&quot; 2008 is expected to be tougher. Sales are expected to slow for both Airbus and Boeing in 2008. But large order backlogs are expected to keep plane makers buoyant during the slow down. It will take six years' of production to fulfil Airbus' current order book. In 2008 the European plane maker expects to deliver more aircraft than in 2007 including 13 A380s to Singapore Airlines, Emirates and Qantas.

Grand airline designsStory Highlights Prince Alwaleed is the first private customer of Airbus' A380 superjumbo  Company sees market for 30 very large VIP jets, half for A380 Flying Palaces  An A380 costs $320 million; there's no limit to the cost of personalized fittings  By  Emma Clarke (CNN) -- The A380 superjumbo can cram 800 passengers in an all-economy layout. On Singapore Airline's version, 471 people sit comfortably in its three classes. But when Saudi billionaire Prince Walid bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud collects his bespoke A380, less than 50 will luxuriate in its 6,000-square feet of space.  Prince Alwaleed's order of a VIP version of the new double-deck airliner -- the first private order for Airbus -- was announced at the Dubai Air Show this week.  &quot;Like all of us, when we buy a new product, we want to trade up to something better,&quot; says Airbus spokesperson, David Velupillai. The A380 &quot;Flying Palace&quot;, as it has been named, is certainly bigger with 50 percent more floor space than the Boeing 747-400, that Prince Alwaleed currently makes do with. Features he may wish to choose include private bedrooms with showers, a movie theatre, a gym with Jacuzzi as well as conference rooms. He'll also need a flight crew of around 15 to operate the luxury jetliner. Following the Saudi prince's ostentatious purchase, deals by other multi-billionaires are likely to surface. Airbus has confirmed there are more VIP orders in the pipeline, but would not disclose who from. Contrary to rumors in the French press, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich was not one, Velupillai told CNN.     The company sees a market for about 30 very large VIP jets, of which it expects the A380 Flying Palace to win at least a half. &quot;There are about 25 VIP and government 747s in service today,&quot; he says. &quot;They will need to be replaced one day, and there will also be increased demand.&quot;  David Lacy, MD of aircraft charter firm, Flightplan says his company is seeing an increase in bookings for personal charters as more travelers shirk the security hassles and time constraints of large airports. The only factor restraining growth, he says, is getting hold of aircraft. &quot;Demand is outstripping supply at the moment.&quot;      Most orders for private jets, however, are for smaller craft in the category of the Learjet or Gulfstream that come with a more modest price tag of between $2-5 million. Airbus and Boeing's VIP versions of the A320 and the 737 sell for around $70 million. Customizing an A380 for private use is on a different league of investment. The plane itself will cost in the region of $300 million but that doesn't include the millions to be lavished on fitting out the plane. Lacy says costs could easily reach $20-30 million for fittings. Other experts have estimated prices could reach $150 million. As Lacy says, &quot;the sky is not the limit.&quot;    Germany's Lufthansa Technik has already designed renderings to give prospective VIP customers an idea of the sort of luxury they can command.  See pictures of the renderings. &raquo; Features include spacious bedrooms on the plane's upper deck, reception areas, a bar or two, offices, private dining rooms and a gym complete with steam bath and exercise machines. On the lower decks VIP guests can meet in lounges or conference areas. And, freed of the burden of cargo, lower areas can be transformed into yet more recreation space, perhaps even a cinema.  This sort of excess is just another purchase for bin Talal, the world's 13th richest person. His wealth down not just come from oil, however. He is founder and chairman of financial investment enterprise, Kingdom Holding Company (KHC) that has assets of around US$ 25 billion and stakes in major corporations including Time Warner, Apple, PepsiCo and Walt Disney Co. The plane will be delivered to bin Talal in 2010, but it is expected to take another two years for the cabin to be fitted. Big things come to those who wait.

Deals from the Dubai air showStory Highlights Prince Alwaleed bin Talal paid around $300 million for an Airbus A380  Deals are expected to top $80 billion  The show saw the largest-ever aircraft order in civil aviation by Emirates    (CNN) -- The most ostentatious deal signed at this year's Dubai Art Show was by Saudi billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who shelled out around $300 million to upgrade his personal Boeing 747 to an Airbus A380 superjumbo.  Other multi-million deals signed by airlines including Emirates Airline, DAE Capital, Qatar Airways and Air Arabia are expected to top $80 billion. Airbus earned the largest windfall, securing $28 billion in commitments, followed by Boeing.  &quot;These are the largest deals for both Boeing and Airbus from these Middle Eastern Airlines,&quot; says Michael Burns, transportation analyst from Booz Allen Hamilton. &quot;Rather than simply re-equipping, they are actually growing for new capacity. So they're ordering lots of new jets very quickly.&quot; The new hubs in the Middle East are creating an impact on air traffic around the world, he adds. &quot;They are taking traffic from all the regional centers in Europe, and funneling them into Asia, Australia and areas like Pakistan. And that means airlines are obviously having to build up capacity. They are expecting to see major growth over the next decade,&quot; he says. Middle Eastern carriers are also starting to lease aircraft in addition to buying them outright, which further allows them to expand more rapidly.  Some of the deals signed at the show     Emirates Airline From: Airbus For: $34.9 billion (The largest-ever aircraft order in civil aviation and beating the total for the whole of 2005 event by US $13.6 billion) Of: 120 A350s, 11 A380s, 12 Boeing 777-300E (total order includes 93 aircraft on firm order and 50 on option.

The long journey to deliveryStory Highlights The superjumbo concept began in 1991 and manufacturing started in 2002   First delay is announced in 2005 followed by senior management resignations  Resignations, cancelled orders, job cuts and delays continue into 2007  Singapore Airlines receives its first delivery in October 2007    (CNN) -- Singapore Airlines received its first A380 superjumbo on 15 October Monday, ready for the first commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney on Thursday 25 October. The wait is over. But getting to this point has been a long, and at times arduous, journey.  The superjumbo concept was first conceived in 1991 when Airbus began talks with major international carriers about requirements for a super-large passenger aircraft. Two years later in January 1993, Boeing joined the Airbus partners Aerospatiale, Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus, Construcciones Aeronauticas and British Aerospace in the studies. But later that year in June 1993, the U.S. airline pulled out, opting instead to research smaller jumbos. (The culmination of this - the 787 Dreamliner - is due next year.) Airbus formed its Large Aircraft Division in 1996. And in 2000 it launched the A3xx project, that was later to become A380. The Airbus consortium became a single integrated company in 2001, comprising four partners from France, Germany, Spain and Great Britain. In January 2002, work began on manufacturing key components and two years later in February 2004, the first engines were delivered by Rolls Royce to the Airbus HQ in Toulouse. Once the first wing was completed in April 2004 in Broughton, Wales, assembly began in the giant &#163;240-million French factory. The first bad news arrived in December 2004 when Airbus' owner, EADS announced the A380 project was &#163;1 billion over budget. On April 27 2005 the A380 took its maiden flight from Toulouse to Bay of Biscay for four hours. In June 2005 the delay annoucements began, when Airbus said it was six months behind delivery schedule.   In March 2006 it passed its evacuation test, with 850 passengers and 20 crew members evacuating the plane in 80 seconds with half the exits blocked. But in June 2006, it was time to announce another six-month delay. The French airline then slashed its 2007 delivery numbers from 25 to nine and announced a $2.5-billion profit warning. EADS' shares plunged by 26 percent. In June 2006, cabin-fitting, paint shop and delivery centers in Hamburg closed down and workload transferred to Toulouse to cut transport costs. In July 2006, Gustav Humbert, Airbus CEO resigned, along with Noel Forgeard, EADS, co-CEO. Christian Streiff stepped in to replace Humbert. BAE agreed to sell its 20 percent stake in Airbus to EADS for $3.53 billion and on September 18 2006, Airbus announced delays for third time and said customers would get deliveries up to two years late. In response, Emirates warned its order was 'up in the air'. And a month later it was told planes would be a further 10 months late. In October 2006, Christian Streiff resigned as Airbus CEO and Louis Gallois took over. Virgin Atlantic deferred its order for four years to 2013. But in October 2006 Airbus also received a fresh order from Qantas for eight more A380s - its first fresh order in 18 months.  But Fedex cancelled its order of 10 A380s on November 8 2006. The super jumbo reached its final step to certification on November 13 2006 with the technical route proving mission. The A380 visited 10 airports, covered 127,788km and crossed both North and South Poles in 18 days and some 152 flight hours. In December 2006, Singapore Airlines bought nine more A380s. That month, the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines received joint European Aviation Safety Agency and FAA Type Certification. But more bad news hit in February when Airbus announced 10,000 jobs cuts and plants up for sale. In March UPS cancelled its $3 billion order of 10 A380-800Fs. A 12-day commercial route proving mission was performed in March 2007 in conjunction with Lufthansa, landing in JFK, ORD, IAD, HKG, FRA and MUN.  The seat auction began on August 27 2007 for seats on Singapore Airlines' first commercial flight. All donations have gone to Singapore's Community Chest, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, Children's Hospital, Westmead and Medecins sans Frontieres. On October 15 2007 A380 is delivered to Singapore Airlines, Toulouse. And at long, long last on October 25 2007, the first commercial flight of the Airbus A380 Super jumbo took off from Singapore to Sydney.

First passengers celebrate A380Story Highlights Singapore Airlines A380 superjumbo completes historic maiden flight  Luxury first class cabins have separate leather seats and double beds   One passenger paid $100,000 for the first Singapore to Sydney trip  by Emma Clarke (CNN) -- It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney.   On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration.  Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the &quot;queen of the skies&quot;. Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was &quot;nothing quite like it&quot;. The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class&quot; cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. &quot;This is not a piece of cake,&quot; he told CNN, &quot;but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers.&quot;  It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them.  As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, &quot;we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind.&quot; But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, &quot;there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money.&quot; But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration.

France: Insider trading at Airbus firmStory Highlights Scandal concerns huge selloff of EADS shares before A380 delays announced  Stock market regulator transfers investigation to Paris prosecutors' office French reports point to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired in June 2006   PARIS, France (CNN) -- The French markets regulator said Tuesday it has found evidence of insider trading at EADS, the parent company of Airbus.  In a report following an 18-month investigation, regulator AMF also alleged EADS had misled financial markets by failing to meet standards on the publication of information. While AMF's announcement did not mention Airbus specifically, its investigation was triggered when top management and shareholders carried out suspicious share trades in the time before EADS revealed severe delays to the production of the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet in June 2006.   Word of those delays caused shares in EADS to drop by a quarter at the time. EADS had reported in March 2006 that certain executives and major shareholders had sold shares during a pre-approved window, but AMF decided to investigate whether anyone who sold those shares knew the bad news about the delays was coming. Aviation analyst Howard Wheeldon, of brokerage firm BGC Partners in London, said the French investigation initially involved 21 people.  &quot;What they actually knew or didn't know in terms of the delay, (whether) there would be a delay announcement forthcoming -- it's very difficult, it's very complicated,&quot; Wheeldon told CNN. &quot;But I do seem to get the impression that the French regulatory authorities have got a long way down the line.&quot; French reports about the investigation have previously pointed to former EADS Director Noel Forgeard, who was fired soon after the delay announcement in June 2006. Forgeard made a profit of some $3 million when he sold his stock in March 2006, and his three children also sold stock options. Forgeard has said the timing of the stock sale and news of the delays were an unfortunate coincidence.  Christian Streiff was hired in July of 2006 to clean up the problems at Airbus, but he resigned in October of that year after the company announced another lengthy delay in A380 production. The A380 finally completed its first passenger flight last October after two years of delays and cost overruns.

'Hassle Heathrow' new terminal opensStory Highlights Heathrow Airport's $8.6 billion new Terminal 5 finally opens to public  The new building took more than 15 years to complete following protests  Building will carry all British Airways traffic   By  CNN's Jim Boulden  LONDON, England (CNN) -- It has taken nearly two decades and $8.6 billion, but London Heathrow's Terminal Five finally opened for business Thursday morning.  When British Airways Flight 26 touched down from Hong Kong at 4:42 a.m. (12:42 a.m. ET), passengers made their way to the 400-meter-long terminal, the largest freestanding building in Britain. With 60 aircraft stands actually attached to two new buildings, &quot;T5&quot; can handle dozens of planes at the same time -- including the new Airbus A380 superjumbo -- and can process 12,000 bags an hour. All of this is for just one occupant: British Airways. It's a new era for BA and the 30 million passengers who will pass through T5 each year. Both have suffered for years at the four older terminals of what's been derided as &quot;Hassle Heathrow.&quot; &quot;I've been very critical of the airport,&quot; BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh told CNN. &quot;(It's) because of the problems we have faced as a result of poor infrastructure at the airport. &quot;So we now have the infrastructure. We have a state of the art baggage system; we've got a state of the art terminal building. We've got lounges like you have never seen before and it will be down to us and it will be down to the people at British Airways to make it a success.&quot; Part of this strategy is to get passengers to the airport earlier to avoid delays. Travelers will be encouraged to check in online, and there will only be 54 of the classic check-in desks compared to 96 self-check-in kiosks. No passengers will be allowed through if they arrive less than 35 minutes before their flight. For those having to wait in the terminal, airport operator BAA built T5 with 112 shops and restaurants, including British chef Gordon Ramsey's first airport eatery. Critics say T5 is just a massive shopping mall, but the architect says it's a throwback to old-fashioned travel. &quot;We wanted to make the experience of being in an airport exciting. We wanted to capture the spirit of travel,&quot; architect Richard Rogers told CNN. &quot;The greatest stations, whether it is New York or London, the 19th century stations did exactly that.&quot;  BA rival Virgin Atlantic calls it a gift for BA. Airport expansion protesters say it's just the latest step in a fierce battle to enlarge the world's busiest international airport. Heathrow sits to the west of London in a densely populated area. There are already plans for a sixth terminal and a third runway. Supporters say expansion is vital for London's economy, but environmentalists say expanding London's three main airports -- Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted -- will only add to harmful climate change.  More expansion may be years away, but T5 will affect most travelers using Heathrow. Many of the other airlines will be shuffled around the other four terminals over the coming months, and next year Terminal Four is expected to undergo major renovation. &quot;Hassle Heathrow&quot; may not be an outdated criticism just yet.

The best of Business Traveller Story Highlights Open Skies: a look at the treaty that will open transatlantic routes to competition  Richard Quest was onboard the first commercial flight of the long-awaited A380   Business Traveller asked the experts how to keep healthy on the road    LONDON, England (CNN) -- This month we take a look back at the best of the best from Business Traveller 2007.   The battle for the skies For more than 40 years, the runways at Heathrow have only been open to 4 carriers...2 from Britain and 2 from the United States. A treaty that was signed last year kicks in at the end March, opening up Heathrow to other carriers that will be allowed to fly this lucrative route. We had a CNN Business Traveller Open Skies Special to get to grips with the treaty and what it means for us travellers. Airbus A380 Superjumbo Two years overdue and billions of dollars over budget -- the Superjumbo finally took its first commercial flight from Singapore to Sydney. We look back on the first impressions of the plane when Richard Quest had one of those coveted seats onboard. Health and well-being on the road Staying healthy on the road can often be hard. Luckily when we were in Zurich, we got some useful exercise tips that can be done from the comfort of your hotel room. Olive oil is a healthy addition to any diet, and that doesn't stop when you're in the air. Those who fly First and Business will be familiar with the single portions of olive oil that comes with the in-flight meal. We visited the olive groves in Perugia to meet the man behind those little bottles of goodness.   Smart Traveller This is one of our regular segments on the show where we road test a new gadget or product and give our honest opinion. One particular gadget that we had a huge response about was the electronic book - tipped to be a number one gadget for 2008. So thought we'd try the Amazon Kindle and Sony e-reader out whilst in Egypt. Sunrise to Sunset We always try and give our viewers ideas to make the most of the cities they're in whilst on business and when we went to Australia it was no different. Sydney has the largest natural harbor in the world and there is plenty to do there from sunrise to sunset.

Any room in first class?Story Highlights First class has for a long time been replaced by enhanced business class services  But airlines are boosting first class service in anticipation of new A380 deliveries  Competition is highest amongst Asian airlines for first class provision  by Emma Clarke (CNN) -- For years it seemed as though first-class air travel was dying a slow death. As perks such as flat beds migrated from the front of the plane backwards, few were willing to pay the 20 percent premium.  Virgin Atlantic didn't even bother with first class when it commenced service in 1984, opting instead for an enhanced business class. Airlines including Continental and Air New Zealand followed and British Airways removed its elite service from some routes. But services such as &quot;business premium&quot;, &quot;business first&quot; and &quot;business elite&quot; haven't triumphed over the $15,000 ticket just yet. There are signs that luxury services are making a glittering return. Emirates Airlines was the first to offer fully-enclosed first class suites when it launched its North American service in 2004. But it was Singapore Airlines that stole the show this year with the suites on board its first A380 Superjumbo. Singapore Airlines has described its new level of service as &quot;beyond first class&quot;, suggesting what an airline must now do to mark the premium service from business class. Behind the sliding doors of the cabins, passengers can get a leather seat completely separate from the bed, a 23-inch widescreen LCD television as well as finest drinks and food designed by leading chefs. There are even double beds for traveling couples. As Chew Choon Seng, Singapore Airline's CEO told CNN on the maiden voyage, &quot;we have always believed in the romance of travel and we are trying to bring back more of that.&quot; The biggest market for first-class is on the longer-haul flights particularly on routes between London and Hong Kong, Sydney and Los Angeles, Singapore and London.    Demand also continues apace amongst the widening upper class in areas such as the Middle East. As a result, competition at the upper end is particularly fierce amongst Asian airlines. Qatar Airways won the 2007 Skytrax Award for its first class service.   Lufthansa Airlines has continued to plough investment into its premium service. But what marks an airline out for its first class offering, says Lufthansa's spokesperson Jan B&auml;rwalde, isn't just the quality of the champagne or caviar on board. &quot;We have learnt that our premium customers want to make the process as easy as possible on the ground and to save as much time as possible.&quot; In 2004 the German airline opened a separate first class terminal in Frankfurt. Here passengers are welcomed by a personal assistant, relieved of their baggage and whisked to one of the lounges. Here passengers wait, eating fine cuisine atop crisp white linen, work in private offices or bathe in furnished suites. Passengers needn't even check the departure board. They will be picked up before take-off and chauffeur-driven in a Mercedes or Porsche directly to the aircraft. Since Lufthansa opened its terminal in November 2004, first class ticket sales have risen by 20 percent. This August the airline opened a new first class lounge in Munich and there are further lounge projects in the pipeline in New York and Paris.    In May, Qantas Airways opened new first-class lounges in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. In an attempt to mirror the service of a five star hotel, passengers can use concierge service to book the best restaurants or seats at venues around the world. Other features include spas, chair-side waiter service, a library, shower suites and work suites. The reason for the upgrade, says the airline, is in anticipation of its delivery of a fleet of Airbus A380s in 2008. While it is unclear whether airlines will follow Singapore Airline's ultra deluxe lead, they will certainly have more space to play with for more first-class seats. And one way to ensure premium sales is by offering premium lounges. Sgns are that more may be willing to escape the increasingly busy business class lounges. As one visitor to Singapore Airline's lounge at Singapore Changi Airport commented on Skytrax's lounge review site, there is a &quot;vast difference between the business and first class lounges. One of the main things I found different was that the Business lounge was crowded and the food selection was poor. The first class lounge is much, much better.&quot; Airlines are responding and re-vamping business-class offering on the ground as well as in the air.   Business travelers using Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class Wing that opened in November at London Heathrow Terminal 3 can move from limo to lounge in less than 10 minutes through a dedicated security channel that emerges directly at the lounge in the terminal. Offering a high service for less was easier before sky-high fuel prices and global terrorism, says Dee Cooper, Virgin Atlantic's director of product. But to keep ticket prices down now, they have to do &quot;clever things&quot;. This comes down to getting the right ratio of crew to passenger, and rethinking food provision. One approach is to improve the quality of the dining experience in the lounge to entice passengers to eat on the ground instead of the air. Leaving flights for sleep instead of eating, Cooper adds, is increasingly more attractive for business passengers who want to arrive at 6am in Heathrow ready for work. As Kieran Daly, editor, Flight Magazine told CNN, &quot;The fact of the matter is that especially on East-bound flights people are asleep. There is really no sense in investing more in the airplane when you could use it in other ways.&quot; Cooper admits the Singapore Airline suite is a &quot;very good product&quot; and the airline will &quot;watch how the market moves&quot; for such luxury. &quot;But at the moment our upper class cabins are full and they are doing really well for us,&quot; she says. And if stars such as the Spice Girls (who will be traveling on Virgin Atlantic during their forthcoming world tour) choose premium business class seats, there are signs that the demand for elite could still be on decline. After all, what's good enough for Victoria... Some of the best first class lounges Qatar Airways, Premium Terminal in Doha: bedrooms for transit passengers; massage sauna and Jacuzzi, restaurant dining Cathay Pacific, The Wing, Hong Kong International Airport: day-break rooms; library, baths. Thai Airways, Royal First class lounge at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi Airport (winner of Skytrax's 2007 best first class lounge): spa facility with gym room, foot-massage and traditional Thai massage; Spa suites and Jacuzzi. Qantas Airways, First Lounges in Sydney and Melbourne: spa, chair-side waiter service, library; garden; showers

Deals from the Dubai air showStory Highlights Prince Alwaleed bin Talal paid around $300 million for an Airbus A380  Deals are expected to top $80 billion  The show saw the largest-ever aircraft order in civil aviation by Emirates    (CNN) -- The most ostentatious deal signed at this year's Dubai Art Show was by Saudi billionaire, Prince Alwaleed bin Talal who shelled out around $300 million to upgrade his personal Boeing 747 to an Airbus A380 superjumbo.  Other multi-million deals signed by airlines including Emirates Airline, DAE Capital, Qatar Airways and Air Arabia are expected to top $80 billion. Airbus earned the largest windfall, securing $28 billion in commitments, followed by Boeing.  &quot;These are the largest deals for both Boeing and Airbus from these Middle Eastern Airlines,&quot; says Michael Burns, transportation analyst from Booz Allen Hamilton. &quot;Rather than simply re-equipping, they are actually growing for new capacity. So they're ordering lots of new jets very quickly.&quot; The new hubs in the Middle East are creating an impact on air traffic around the world, he adds. &quot;They are taking traffic from all the regional centers in Europe, and funneling them into Asia, Australia and areas like Pakistan. And that means airlines are obviously having to build up capacity. They are expecting to see major growth over the next decade,&quot; he says. Middle Eastern carriers are also starting to lease aircraft in addition to buying them outright, which further allows them to expand more rapidly.  Some of the deals signed at the show     Emirates Airline From: Airbus For: $34.9 billion (The largest-ever aircraft order in civil aviation and beating the total for the whole of 2005 event by US $13.6 billion) Of: 120 A350s, 11 A380s, 12 Boeing 777-300E (total order includes 93 aircraft on firm order and 50 on option.

Supersonic, manta rays or slower planes? The future of air travelStory Highlights Future aircraft could use techniques found in nature to increase lift, efficiency  Craft could look like manta rays or have bird-like wings that morph mid-flight  Scientists claim aircraft's fuel consumption could be cut by 50 percent  A new breed of supersonic craft could carry a select few  By  Mairi Mackay for CNN LONDON, England (CNN) -- White contrails crisscrossing the sky over every major metropolis are a constant visual reminder of the fundamental role of airplanes in modern life.  A world without air travel is inconceivable, but what might it be like in the future? Is the jumbo's jumbo, the Airbus A380, a taste of bigger craft to come? And with energy sources in question, will we even be flying? Passenger travel is growing at a rate of three percent each year, with air-freight growing even faster. Current projections estimate the number of people traveling by air -- both in the US and abroad -- will double or even triple by 2030. Meanwhile, fuel prices are hitting record highs, with analysts increasingly expecting oil to break the $100-a-barrel mark, while airplanes are branded as global warming enemy number one because of their habit of depositing CO2 emissions high in the atmosphere. A legion of aeronautical researchers and designers around the world are seeking to keep up with future demand for air travel while reducing its environmental impact and increase its efficiency. But is it possible? Dr Juan Alonso, head of NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics program certainly thinks so. Current research points to a dramatic re-design of airplanes which will not only accommodate higher volumes of air travel but will also be more environmentally friendly than today's craft. &quot;We have to come up with solutions in the aerospace world. A large part of these solutions come from introducing aircraft with new technologies,&quot; explained Dr Alonso. One of the major drivers in aircraft research is improving craft efficiency. It is conceivable that in craft of the future, fuel burn - which directly affects energy use and environmental impact - could be reduced by anything up to fifty percent. One way to do this is to change the shape of aircraft. &quot;Currently we use the tube and wing paradigm,&quot; explained Dr Alonso. &quot;We've optimized the heck out of that concept. The Airbus [A380] is almost as good as it can get.&quot;  There is still much debate going on in aeronautical circles, with Boeing, the European Research Program and NASA all searching for the optimum aircraft shape. &quot;Laminar flow,&quot; where the turbulence of airflow over a craft's surface is reduced, is one possibility being explored. Laminar planes borrow the huge wingspan of gliders, which maximize laminar flow, with hi-tech smart materials supporting the wings. Researchers are also looking at using very advanced computers to constantly monitor the load on aircraft wings and change their shape for maximum efficiency in the air. Taking inspiration from nature, these craft mimic the movement of bird and insect wings by morphing dramatically mid-flight. But currently, the blended wing body looks like one of the best contenders for the future. Research is being conducted by NASA, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boeing into the radically changed airframe, which is similar in shape to a manta ray. Blended wing body concept The SAX 40 aircraft prototype -- a blended wing body aircraft -- is the fruit of the Silent Aircraft Initiative, a three-year multi-million dollar collaborative project between Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Cambridge University, England. As the name implies, the main thrust of the project was to find ways to make planes quieter. But the team found that the same technological changes that make craft quieter also make them more fuel-efficient. &quot;[This aircraft] provides a lot of opportunity to reduce noise and emissions which is linked to fuel burn. It has the potential to change the game for noise and fuel burn,&quot; Zoltan Spakovszky, H. N. Slater Associate Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT and lead researcher in the Silent Aircraft Initiative told CNN. The blended wing aircraft spreads out the fuselage generating lift compared with the current airplane paradigm -- tube and wing -- in which lift is entirely generated by the wings. This immediately boosts fuel-efficiency. The SAX 40 embeds the engine in the airframe allowing it to shield noise radiated forward from the engine fans. This is a big step forward particularly at takeoff and landing, where the 'little hurricanes' of air created by the jet engines account for most of the huge roar. Embedded engines also reduce aircraft drag, and consequently fuel-burn, making the craft much more efficient. But conjuring this plane from theory will be challenging. New flexible materials are needed to accommodate the changed architecture of the fuselage, while embedding engines in the fuselage also has many design implications, not least maintenance access. &quot;It's a question of can we overcome some [of the] technological risks,&quot; Professor Spakovszky explained. But researchers' predictions may be persuasive enough to entice big business. The SAX 40 is projected to fly 149 passenger-miles per gallon of fuel compared to 120 miles for the best current aircraft of its range and size -- an equivalent fuel efficiency to a Toyota Prius Hybrid car carrying two passengers -- while cutting noise outside the airport perimeter from around 88 decibels to 63. &quot;People around airports worry about noise, but global warming is a much bigger problem,&quot; Professor Spakovszky told CNN. &quot;If you trade the noise reduction for fuel-burn you have a very efficient airframe.&quot; Spakovszky is now heading up a new three-year, NASA and Boeing-sponsored project to push blended wing concepts forward and increase fuel efficiency. Lower speeds and altitudes to cut fuel by half In common with both Alonso at NASA and Spakovszky at MIT, Ilan Kroo, Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Stanford University believes environmental constraints will be the most critical aspects of future air travel. &quot;To enable air travel at all we may see a very different kind of airplane and very different kind of operation,&quot; he told CNN. Kroo believes the way we fly planes may change. Currently all commercial airliners cruise at speeds of around Mach 0.85 (85 percent of the speed of sound). Kroo believes in the future planes may slow down, say from Mach 0.85 to Mach 0.75. He also believes planes could fly at lower altitudes because of concerns that contrails affect the atmosphere. Other environmental impacts would also be reduced. Nitrogen oxide emissions, unburned hydrocarbons and water vapor all have an impact strongly related to how long they stay in the atmosphere: lower altitudes help reduce this. &quot;It's uncertain, but people are actively planning flight paths at lower speeds and altitudes. The sky in the future may not be filled with white lines,&quot; Kroo said. This would mean very efficient airplanes flying at slightly slower speeds -- a small change in convenience but a profound reduction in environmental impact. A reduction in fuel burn of 50 percent is not out of the question, according to Kroo. Supersonic flight -- for a select few... At the other end of the spectrum, efficient supersonic travel could see travel times cut in half by 2030, affecting global commerce dramatically. Research is being conducted into flying at twice the speed of sound but in a manner very different from the world's only other dalliance with supersonic flight -- Concorde. There are active programs in Europe, Japan and the US looking into noise reduction technologies for supersonic flight. Supersonic craft of the future will also have a similar environmental impact as subsonic craft. Supersonic craft of the future are most likely to be small, seating eight to ten passengers, and initially used for business travel. Air travel: a future revolution? But whether it's manta ray-shaped planes, slower and lower flight paths or a new breed of supersonic air craft, air travel of the future is set to transform. &quot;Improvements in performance, in noise and emissions are required,&quot; said NASA's Dr Alonso. &quot;They are not incremental changes. We will need to come up with radical concepts. I would qualify it as a revolution.&quot; .........................................     Does increased air travel have a role in our future? Should we fly less to combat global warming? Share your views and read others' thoughts in the Just Imagine forum.

Superjumbo ends historic flightStory Highlights Singapore Airlines A380 superjumbo ends historic maiden flight  Delivery comes nearly two years late; Emirates, Qantas still waiting for planes  Problems have caused major crisis for Airbus   SINGAPORE (CNN) -- The world's biggest jetliner ever built completed its first commercial flight on Thursday, a new chapter in air transportation.  The Singapore Airlines-owned Airbus A380 superjumbo touched down in foggy Sydney, Australia, at 5:24 p.m. local time (0724 GMT), just over seven hours after it began its historic flight from Singapore. The airline was carrying nearly 500 passengers and crew. Some passengers bid up to $100,000 for a seat on the historical trip.  The superjumbo took off on schedule at 8.16 a.m. (0016 GMT) on a 7 1/2-hour flight that launched a new era in air travel.    The Associated Press reported the flight carried 455 passengers and a crew of about 30, including four pilots. Among the passengers was CNN's Richard Quest.  Watch superjumbo land in Sydney. &raquo; &quot;It was an amazing experience,&quot; Quest said, shortly after disembarking the plane in Sydney.   &quot;There was a cheer on take-off, a cheer on landing. There was a party atmosphere.&quot;  Watch Quest's excitement at traveling on superjumbo. &raquo; Airports have had to redesign terminals to accommodate the the world's largest passenger jet, which has a wingspan of nearly 80 meters. The 6,300-kilometer (3,900 mile) Singapore Airlines scheduled flight marked the end of a much longer journey for the aircraft, the delivery of which was delayed by nearly two years, with costs running billions of dollars over budget.  The problems left Airbus in crisis, forcing the manufacturer to cut 10,000 jobs and sell off plants in a major reshuffle as it struggled against a weak dollar and stiff competition from U.S. rival Boeing. The delays led to canceled orders.   In October 2006, Christian Streiff resigned as Airbus CEO. Louis Gallois took over. Virgin Atlantic deferred its order for four years to 2013. Critics have seen the jet as an environmental concern at a time when the aviation industry is under pressure as one of the biggest producers of carbon dioxide, seen as a key factor in global warning. Airbus has insisted the A380, capable of carrying up to 850 people in all-economy mode, is more fuel efficient and is banking on the jet to open up a new front in the battle for the commercial skies.    While Airbus is likely to be buoyed by delays to Boeing's rival creation -- a jet promising faster, more environmentally-friendly flights -- orders for the 787 Dreamliner aircraft are now in excess of 710 from 51 customers.  Watch A380's troubled birth. &raquo; In addition to Singapore Airlines, Airbus will also supply 14 customers including British Airways, Virgin, Emirates and Lufthansa with orders totaling 180 aircraft.  &quot;This is clearly the plane that will be required for certain routes where you need to move large numbers of people,&quot; says Richard Quest. &quot;&quot;But I do not believe that in the short term, people are going to buy this plane in the dozens in the same way they bought the 747.&quot;  Singapore Airlines will begin fully scheduled A380 flights to Sydney on Sunday. A superjumbo service on the Singapore-London route is expected to start in February. The airline says its jets will set a &quot;new standard for luxury and comfort,&quot; fitted with 399 economy seats, 60 business seats and 12 Givenchy-designed &quot;suites&quot; featuring a flat bed behind sliding doors.

Airbus delivers long-delayed A380Story Highlights Singapore Airlines takes delivery of first Airbus A380, the world's largest airliner  First scheduled service begins Oct. 28 between Singapore and Sydney  Delivery comes nearly two years late; Emirates, Qantas still waiting for planes  Singapore chief executive Chew says plane marks a &quot;new chapter&quot; for aviation   TOULOUSE, France (CNN) -- Singapore Airlines on Monday became the first customer to take delivery the Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger jet, in what the airline's chief executive called &quot;a dream come true.&quot;  &quot;This delivery really marks the beginning of a new chapter for the aviation industry,&quot; chief executive Chew Choon Seng said at a presentation ceremony at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France. The double-decker plane can carry up to 550 passengers, but the roomy design for Singapore Airlines seats 471. Singapore's jet includes a first class with 12 enclosed &quot;suites,&quot; each containing a seat and full-size mattress. Business class has four seats across, each reclining to become fully flat for sleeping. Economy features greater legroom, larger video screens, and a PC power outlet at each seat. Chew said the plane sets a &quot;new standard for luxury and comfort&quot; in a commercial aircraft. The A380 is expected to take off for Singapore on Tuesday. The airline says the first scheduled service begins Oct. 28 between Singapore and Sydney.  &quot;The A380 is unquestionably the defining aircraft of its generation,&quot; said Airbus chief executive Tom Enders, &quot;and the airlines operating it will be in a class of their own.&quot; Other airlines awaiting delivery of the plane include Emirates Airlines and Qantas. While nearly two years late, delivery of the A380 comes as Airbus rival Boeing announced a six-month delay in delivery of its premier plane, the 787 Dreamliner.

Oil retreats toward $130 a barrel in AsiaStory Highlights Oil retreats ahead of a report expected to show U.S. inventories grew last week   Midday in Singapore Thursday, crude oil was down 71 cents at $130.32 a barrel   Prices have been affected by threats against Nigerian oil facilities  Falling gasoline demand in the U.S. and volatility in the dollar have also driven rise    BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Oil fell back toward $130 a barrel Thursday in Asia ahead of a report expected to show U.S. inventories of crude and petroleum products grew last week.  Prices remained volatile, though. Crude oil futures dipped below $126 a barrel Wednesday in New York before recovering to finish just above $131. Oil is being buffeted about by threats against Nigerian oil facilities, worries about falling gasoline demand in the U.S. and volatility in the dollar. Midday in Singapore, the light, sweet crude contract for July delivery was down 71 cents at $130.32 a barrel in electronic trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract finished the previous session at $131.03, up $2.18, after spending much of the day swinging between gains and losses. At its low in the floor session Wednesday, oil was more than $9 off the record high it hit last week above $135 a barrel. The reversal in Asia from the floor session's close came with a renewed strengthening of the dollar and ahead of the U.S. Energy Department's inventory report, to be released later Thursday.    In the last couple of days, the dollar has rebounded against both the euro and yen, receiving some support Wednesday as the U.S. Commerce Department said orders to American factories for big-ticket manufactured goods fell by a smaller-than-expected amount in April.  Watch fishermen in Spain strike over high fuel costs &raquo; That was taken as a possible signal of a rebound in the slumping U.S. manufacturing sector, and in Asia currency trading the dollar was back near the 105 yen level, while the euro was around $1.5650. When the dollar declines, investors tend to buy commodities such as oil as a hedge against inflation. But a stronger dollar makes oil more expensive to investors dealing in other currencies, and the tendency usually reverses. Also, a survey of analysts by Platts, the energy research arm of McGraw-Hill Cos., indicated that U.S. crude oil stocks were expected to have grown 750,000 barrels in the week ended May 23. The Platts survey also indicated analysts were expecting a build in U.S. gasoline stock of 400,000 barrels, and a build in distillate stocks, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, of 800,000 barrels.   Prices were still being supported, though, by further threats against Nigerian oil facilities. Those threats led investors in the U.S. to at least temporarily set aside concerns about falling gasoline demand.  Watch how rebel activity in Nigeria is affecting oil prices &raquo; On Wednesday, the Nigerian rebel group The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta threatened new attacks on oil installations to mark the one-year anniversary of President Umaru Yar'Adua's inauguration. A weekend attack by the group on an oil facility cut about 130,000 barrels of the nation's oil production, according to Addison Armstrong, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, in a research note. News of disruptions in Nigeria, one of Africa's largest producers and a major U.S. supplier, have helped push oil prices higher over the past year. That contended Wednesday with the growing belief that U.S. demand for gasoline is falling as the average retail pump prices approaches $4 a gallon. That belief was supported by two new surveys showing Americans consuming less gasoline. Demand for gasoline fell 5.5 percent last week compared to the same week last year, according to the weekly MasterCard SpendingPulse survey. The survey also found that, on average, demand over the past four weeks is off 6.3 percent compared to the same period last year. A separate CreditCards.com survey of about 1,000 people found that more than half have cut back on their driving due to high fuel prices.  In other Nymex trading, heating oil futures fell 1 cent to $3.8143 a gallon while gasoline prices dropped 1.01 cents to $3.4375 a gallon. Natural gas futures rose 4 cents to $12.035 per 1,000 cubic feet. July Brent crude fell 81 cents to $130.12 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange in London.
